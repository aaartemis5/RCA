The uncontrolled growth in urban areas has left many Indian cities deficient in infrastructural services as water supply, sewerage, storm water drainage, and solid waste management. Most urban areas inhabited by slums in the country are plagued by acute problems related to indiscriminate disposal of sewage. Due to deficient efforts by town/city authorities, sewage and its management has become a tenacious problem and this is notwithstanding the fact that the large part of the municipal expenditure is allotted to it. It is not uncommon to find that substantially a large portion of resources is being utilized on manning sewerage system by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for their operation and maintenance",

There has been no major effort to create community awareness either about the likely perils due to poor sewage management or the simple steps that every citizen can take which will help in reducing sewage generation and promote effective management of its generation and treatment. The degree of community sensitization and public awareness is low. There is no system of segregation of black water (from toilets) and grey water (other liquid wastes) at household level.

When untreated sewage accumulates and is allowed to become septic, the decomposition of its organic matter leads to nuisance conditions including the production of malodorous gases.

Its treatment can be perceived as “unloading the conveyor belt” to make the belt useable again. The crucial issue is water in the conveyor belt. Thus, treated sewage must ultimately return to receiving water bodies or on to the land or might be reused for specific purposes after proper treatment specified for the purpose. The complex question faced by the design and practicing engineers is: What levels of treatment must be achieved in a given type of treatment – beyond those prescribed by discharge standards – to ensure protection of the health of the community and the environment? The answer to this question requires detailed analyses of local conditions and needs, application of scientific knowledge and engineering judgment based on past experience, and consideration of central, state, and local regulations.

These often comprise, in sewerage and sanitation sub- sector, construction of sewers, on-site sanitation facilities using various types of latrines. Under certain hydrological conditions, unsewered sanitation can cause severe groundwater contamination by pathogens and nitrate, which may largely negate the expected health benefits of such programs.

It extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death – to include equivalent years of ‘healthy’ life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability. In doing so, mortality and morbidity are combined into a single common-matrix. As per the WHO report, 80% of the diseases in human being are water-borne and water-related.

As per the estimate, over 50 million people in urban India defecate in the open every day. The cost in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) of diarrhoeal diseases for children from poor sanitation is estimated at Rs. 500 crores. The cost per DALY per person due to poor sanitation is estimated at Rs. 5,400 and due to poor hygiene practices at Rs. 900 (MoUD 2009).

Also, rampant worm infestation and repeated diarrhoea episodes result in widespread childhood malnutrition. Moreover, India is losing millions of rupees each year because of poor sanitation. Illnesses are costly to families, and to the economy as a whole in terms of productivity losses and expenditure on medicines, healthcare, etc. The economic toll is also apparent in terms of water treatment costs, losses in fisheries production and tourism, and welfare impacts, such as reduced school attendance, inconvenience, wasted time, and lack of privacy and security for women",

The Twelfth Schedule brings into the municipal domain among others such areas such as urban and town planning, regulation of land-use, planning for economic and social development, ‘safeguarding the interests of weaker sections of Society’. The Constitution thus envisages ULBs as being totally responsible for all aspects of development, civic services, and environment in the cities, going far beyond the traditional role",

This method thus takes into account the prevailing and anticipated birth rates and death rates of the region or city for the period under consideration.

The jet in these machines is a “jack hammer” action through a triplex plunger pump releasing the treated sewage backwards as in Figure 3.10 and the hydraulic pressures are in the range of 50 to 60 bar. The jet in the reverse direction of sewer flow acts like an airplane jet and propels the nozzle forwards and thus drills through the choked up blocks and clears the obstructions however tough they are",

Jacking of permanent tunnel lining is generally adopted for sewers of sizes varying from 750 to 2,750 mm, depending upon the conditions of soil and the location of the line.

The jacking is generally started from an entry pit. The excavation can be done manually or by using machines. However, it is accomplished with workers inside the pipe. The excavation method varies from the very basic process of workers digging the face with pick and shovel to the use of highly sophisticated tunnel boring machines. Since the method requires personnel working inside the pipe, the method is limited to personnel entry size pipes. Hence the minimum pipe diameter recommended by this method is 1060 mm outside diameter.

Sewage collection and treatment systems are more prone to corrosion in view of the nature of the sewage. Since sewage contains solids which are more likely to cause abrasion in sewers, pumps and their components thus removing the protective coating and accelerating the corrosion process, corrosion control becomes all the more important in sewerage systems. It is particularly acute in areas where sewage strength is high, sulphate content of water is substantial and average temperature is above 20ºC.

If the corrosion products adhere to the surface of the concrete a certain measure of protection against further acid attack is provided.

Except in the cases where sewage is quite weak and in a fairly well aerated condition, high sulphide generation because of large slime areas can be expected in completely filled sewer lines. Force mains, therefore should be kept to a minimum. Since biological activity is concentrated largely in the slime layer, it increases with an increase of the wetted perimeter. The oxygen uptake is proportional to the surface width of the stream. Therefore, it follows that deep flow in a pipe is more conducive to sulphide generation than shallow flow.

It is difficult to design and construct such a rectangular structure at deep depths. Hence, the recommended procedure is to construct the circular well first and fill up the arc sections with partitioned mass concrete to get at the rectangular passage. The design is invariably governed by equipment manufacturers who use the DWF and peak flows as the basis.

In such a case, the volume in the sewers calculated at 0.8 times their total volume can be considered as the extended wet well volume. This is illustrated in Table 4.1",

Moreover, designing and constructing the wet wells to be checked for cracking stress in high water table areas may be not only difficult but may give way to infiltration which will be a challenge to control later on. Thus, it becomes a problem of obtaining sufficient wet well volume at reasonable cost. A solution to this is proposed in Chapter 6 titled pumps and pumping stations of the book “Wastewater Engineering, collection, treatment and disposal” by Metcalf & Eddy, TMH edition, 1974. Which states, “The effective volume V of the wet well between “on” and “off” float switch settings includes the storage in the incoming sewers. If the “on” switch setting is below the sewer invert, no storage is available. This setting is wasteful of both the storage capacity and head available in sewers of appreciable size. It also wastes power and may require higher head pumps and larger horsepower motors",

Where it is necessary to rely on the storage in the sewers to obtain adequate wet well volume for control, backwater curves should be computed to obtain the effective volume between the various float switch settings. This may amount to 50% of the volume in the wet well itself. Some stations have been built with practically no wet well and in the case of really large stations, the wet well volume within the station approaches insignificance. In these cases, the only volume available for control is the storage volume in the sewers.” It is also a matter for consideration to move on to immersible pump sets in future where the submergence in sewage is not needed and the motor winding cooling is provided by an internal oil chamber around it.

In a double-suction pump, the impeller is actually a composite impeller, with two identical flow- passages combined back to back. Each side is practically an independent impeller and each such impeller handles only half the flow. So, the specific speed for such pumps is calculated by taking only half the flow. By this the specific speed of a double-suction pump is only 70% of what the specific speed would have been with a single-suction design.

It is always advisable to avoid suction- lift for any centrifugal pump. In sewage stations the pumps are hence installed either to work submerged in the wet well itself or installed in the dry well at such a level that the impeller will be below the level of the liquid in the wet well. The power-characteristics of the centrifugal pumps are also related to the specific speed.

However, in the case of axial flow pumps, the power needed to be input to the pump is maximum at zero flow. These pumps should hence be started with the delivery valve fully open.

Because the centrifugal pumps used more commonly for clean, clear liquids, enclosed impellers are the most common construction. The impellers are constructed of the semi-open or open type depending on the size of the solids and the consistency of solids to be handled. For handling large-size solids, the impellers are also designed with fewer vanes which would however have less efficiency.

Multi-staging would make the head attainable, as is typically seen in vertical turbine pumps. In multi-stage construction, the flow out of one impeller is carried to the suction of the next impeller, with some conversion of the kinetic energy into pressure-energy in a bowl or a diffuser. In single-stage pumps the energy conversion is achieved in a volute casing around the impeller. For ease of access to the internals the volute casing is often made of the axially split type. This facilitates accessing all the rotating parts for cleaning or repairs, without disturbing the fixation of the pump with the adjoining suction and delivery piping.",

By this the potential head component in the total head would keep increasing. Converse will be the case when the inflow is more than the discharge by the pumps.

Pumps discharging into a common closed header/conduit are said to be running in parallel. The flow obtained in the header is what is contributed by all the running pumps together. The combined characteristics of pumps running in parallel is obtained by reading against different heads, the values of the Q obtainable from the individual pumps and plotting the addition of the Q-values against respective heads, as illustrated in Figure 4.10 The operating point of parallel operation is the point of intersection of the combined H-Q curve with the system head curve. Because the point of intersection on the combined characteristics is at a head higher than that at the point of intersection on the H-Q curve of a single pump, the discharge at the operating point will be the intersection on the H-Q curve of a single pump",

That means to double the discharge capacity of pumping, it is not adequate to commission two pumps in parallel operation. One must study what combination of pumps of different H-Q characteristics can give such combined characteristics as to have an intersection on the combined characteristics at the desired double discharge. As seen from Figure 4.10, if there are two identical pumps running in parallel, individual pump would be contributing a discharge Qp.

Such H-Q curve is called unstable, because at heads higher than the shut-off head, the discharge of the pumps keeps hunting between two values, causing the pump’s performance to be unstable. Such instability is prone to cause the pump to even suffer vibrations. This becomes more hazardous in parallel operation, because the hunting of flow of the unstable pump causes the other pumps also to experience continuous change in their share and in turn hunting, instability and vibrations. Pumps to be put into parallel operation should hence be only of stable H-Q curve or care should be taken that the system head will definitely be safely less than the shut-off head of the pump with unstable curve.",

This higher design velocity allows the use of smaller pipe, reducing construction costs. Higher velocity also increases pipeline friction loss resulting in increased energy costs. The maximum velocity at peak conditions is recommended not to exceed 3 m/s.

A judicious selection of the pipe diameter is implied in dealing with sewage pumping mains. The reason for recommending the minimum velocity as 1 m/s is based on the fact that sewage in India invariably brings in considerable grit and even though grit removal is provided in pumping stations, there can be times when either the equipment is under repair or the grit actually passes through at peak flows and when the peak flow tapers off it accumulates in the pipeline and virtually reduces the sectional area and",

Sewage pumping mains of especially RCC can suffer corrosion by sulphide gas which forms and gets liberated inside these mains due to the velocity conditions. Whenever the velocities are too small, the organic materials get settled out and undergo anaerobic decay and release the sulphide which later combines with the moisture and forms sulphurous and sulphuric acid.

Shallow depths will not only result in loose solids concentration requiring huge volumes of flow to be handled for withdrawing a desired volume of sludge solids.

However, it is not the case in primary clarifiers. Thus, a fine balance is needed in deciding these two parameters in secondary clarifiers. The depth also influences the hydraulic pattern. Higher depths may cause dead zones and shallow depths may cause short circuiting between sewage released in the baffle zone.

The plant itself consists of an aeration tank, a secondary settling tank, a sludge return line and an excess sludge waste line leading to a digester. The BOD removal in the process is 85-92%. The plant employs a plug flow regime which is achieved by a long and narrow configuration of the aeration tank with length equal to 5 or more times the width. The sewage and mixed liquor are set in at the head of the tank and withdrawn at its end. Because of the plug flow regime, the oxygen demand at the head of the aeration tank is high and then tapers down. However, air is supplied in the process at a uniform rate along the length of the tank. This leads to either oxygen deficiency in the initial zone or wasteful application of air in the subsequent reaches. Another limitation of the plug flow regime is that there is a lack of operational stability at times of excessive variation in rate of inflow and in influent strength",

Troubles due to clogging from the inside can be reduced by providing air filters and those due to clogging from outside can be avoided by providing adequate air pressure below the diffusers at all times. In spite of such precautions, fine bubble diffusers will require periodical cleaning.

Flow conditions in aerated lagoons are neither ideal complete-mixing nor ideal plug- flow in nature. They are dependent on lagoon geometry and are better described by dispersed flow models of the type given by Wehner and Wilhem for first-order kinetics and hence the design procedure given below takes treatability of the waste, temperature and mixing conditions into account.

The waste may contain inhibitory substances which would retard the activity of methane producing organisms and not affect the activity of acid producers to the same extent. In treatment of domestic or municipal sewage such a condition, however, would rarely arise. The other reason for the imbalance may be a fall in temperature of the pond. The activity of methane bacteria decreases much more rapidly with decreasing temperature as compared to the acid formers and gas production stops at temperatures lower than 15ºC",

The chemical precipitation of phosphorous is by the use of Ferric or Aluminium salts. For each Kg of phosphorous 0.9 kg of Aluminium or 1.8 kg of Iron is needed, showing that the sludge production is less by half by using Aluminium.

Besides, the technology of biological nitrification denitrification in built in secondary treatment has been seen to be effective in virtually eliminating ammonia as nitrogen gas and this avoids the need for chemicals and equipment as an add on stage after secondary treatment. Biological removal of phosphorous has undergone many advances since the days of Prof Barnard, the father of biological phosphorous removal. Thus, it appears prudent to adopt such biological treatments which have an in built removal of nitrogen and phosphorous along with the traditional BOD removal instead of merely continuing to adopt the BOD removal processes alone. Some of the biological STPs built in India have already established such a performance like the Koramangala and Chellagatta valley STP at Bengaluru constructed during 2004 under JICA assistance and some of the recent SBR plants.",

It is like an ambulance to take a patient to a hospital with oxygen and drips etc. during the transit. Modern systems use a “double conversion” method of accepting AC input, rectifying to DC for passing through the rechargeable battery and then inverting back to AC for powering the protected equipment through a line-interactive UPS. Most UPS below 1 kVA rating is line-interactive type where there is an additional multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer which can boost or buck the powered coils of wire to regulate the output voltage fairly steady.

There are many types of corrosion, the major types being galvanic, concentration ceil, stray current, stress and bacterial. Wastewater collection and treatment systems are more prone to corrosion in view of the nature of the sewage. Since sewage contains solids which are more likely to cause abrasion in sewers, pumps and their components thus removing the protective coating and accelerating the corrosion process, corrosion control becomes all the more important in sewerage systems. It is particularly acute in areas where sewage strength is high, sulphate content of water is substantial and average temperature is above 20ºC. The corrosion problem in sewerage systems can be categorized as (1) Corrosion of sewers and (2) Corrosion of treatment systems.",

Oxygen which is normally present in the air between the crown and the sewage, H2S, a necessary prerequisite for sewer corrosion and C02 are usually present in the sewer air.

Expansion caused by these reactions results in spalling of the surface of the concrete, thereby exposing underlying layers of concrete to further attack. If the corrosion products adhere to the surface of the concrete a certain measure of protection against further acid attack is provided. Sulphuric acid, in fact, does not and cannot penetrate into normal concrete. Acid attack therefore takes place at the surface only. The most outstanding character of this form of corrosion is the fact that it only occurs above the water line in the sewer.

Velocities giving high, single point turbulence may, however, result in sulphide release and severe odour and/or corrosion. Except in the cases where sewage is quite weak and in a fairly well aerated condition, high sulphide generation because of large slime areas can be expected in completely filled lines.

Accordingly where sulphide generation is a critical consideration, a larger pipe is always better than a smaller one for any given slope and sewage flow. Turbulence caused by high velocities for short distances or improper design of junction manholes permitting sewage lines to intersect at right angles or at different elevations should be avoided as turbulence can cause excessive release of H2S even where sewage contains only a small amount of dissolved sulphides.

Zinc, aluminium and magnesium (with sufficient purity) or their alloys which are higher up in the galvanic series must be used for this purpose, Sheets of zinc suspended in a coagulation basin is an example, A single protector anode will not be sufficient and it will be necessary to install a number of such anodes generally spaced at 4 to 6 m in the pipeline or the structures to be protected.

A conventional ASP can be upgraded without increasing the footprint by opting for an MBBR to be inscribed in the aeration tank and duplicating the hydraulic piping and pump sets and the primary clarifiers can be modified as rim flow clarifiers and 5-129 secondary clarifiers inscribed with tube settlers. 2. Stabilization Ponds can be upgraded to aerated lagoons on extended aeration mode with bund partitions to carve out the sedimentation zones. 3. Aerated lagoons can be upgraded with bio-towers inscribed at one end and boosting the delivery head of pump sets by on line add on pump sets or replacements. 4",

The partitioning has to be by inscribing a separate structure for contact aeration preferably circular and without opening out the reinforcements of the old tank base slab or sidewalls. 6.

This process consists of tanks arranged in this sequence: anaerobic tank, anoxic tank and oxic tank. Influent and return activated sludge flow into the anaerobic tank while nitrified liquor is recycled with a circulating pump from the oxic (nitrification) tank to the anoxic (denitrification) tank. Ammonia nitrogen is oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the oxic tank, and then nitrite or nitrate is denitrified to nitrogen gas in the anoxic tank.

This process does not need primary and final sedimentation tanks, and disinfection facilities; therefore, it requires smaller space than conventional biological systems (generally around 1/3 of ASP system). ii. Since high MLSS concentration can be maintained in a reaction tank, MBRs operate at higher volumetric loading rates which result in lower hydraulic retention times. The low retention times mean that less space is required compared to a conventional system. iii. High MLSS concentration in a reaction tank enables dewatering of the excess sludge withdrawn from the reaction tank directly without thickening. iv. The effluent from MBRs is very transparent and fine containing almost no TSS. Organic matters (BOD) are well removed because of lower concentration of TSS compared with ASP process. Phosphorus also can be removed by adding coagulant in reaction tank. v",

E-coli is almost certainly blocked by MF membrane with pore size of less than 0.4 micro meters which is generally used for MBR system. vii. Treated water by MBR can be reused for various purposes such as toilet flushing, gardening, etc. without additional treatment. viii.

The only difference is in the activated sludge process, the sewage flows through an aeration tank and then through a settling tank continuously whereas in the SBR, the aeration and settling phases are carried out in batch mode one after the other in the same tank. Consequently, at least two SBRs are needed in parallel so that when one is in aeration, the other can be in settling and decanting of the supernatant. In fact the activated process can be referred to as continuous flow reactor (CFR). For this reason, the footprint on like to like basis of this type of SBR will be higher in the case of SBR. In the CFR the suspended solids in the settling tank are constantly under simultaneous influence of opposing upward hydraulics of the overflowing treated sewage and gravitational setting of the suspended solids. In the SBR, this is got over by batch setting",

A cycle is typically referenced as the time duration between successive decant sequencing during which the liquid level moves from a lower water depth (bottom water level) to its fill depth (top water level) and back to its lower water depth (bottom water level).

The one handicap is the inability to derive the design guidelines for an STP. This is because, depending on the media that is used the available area for microbes to grow in a given volume of the reaction tanks varies rather widely and this compounds the formulation of a fundamentally reliable design equation. At this moment, heavy reliance on the eventual builders of these MBBR type STPs and the realization cum intangibles of their guarantees seems unavoidable.",

As a standard feature of the technology the reactors are covered by a shading structure or a greenhouse. As the influent travels through the cascade, the available nutrient quantity is consumed and as a result, the composition of the ecosystem fixed in the biofilm changes from reactor to reactor, gradually adapting itself to the decreasing nutrient concentration.

The big difference is the scheme in Figure 5.2 will generate methane and in turn electrical energy by burning it in gas engines, whereas the scheme in Figure 5.1 will need pumping oxygen by means of aeration where electrical energy is expended. Obviously, the scheme in Figure 5.2 is the preferred option but it requires the temperature to be in the range of above 25ºC.

As a result, the digester contents are allowed to stratify, thereby forming four distinct layers: a floating layer of scum, layer of supernatant, layer of actively digesting sludge and a bottom layer of digested sludge; essentially the decomposition is restricted to the middle and bottom layers.

The SRT is equivalent to the hydraulic retention time, that is, volume of digester/volume of sludge withdrawn per day. Experiments have proved that percentage of destruction of volatile solids and formation of methane decreases as the SRT is reduced.

This effect of natural mixing is significant, particularly in case of high rate digesters fed continuously. However, this natural mixing is not sufficient to ensure stable performance of the digestion process. Therefore, methods used for mixing include external pumped circulation, internal mechanical mixing and internal gas mixing. External pumped circulation while relatively simple is limited in application because of large flow rates involved. However, this method can achieve substantial mixing, provided that sufficient energy in the range of 5-8 watts/m3 is dissipated in the digester.

Mechanical mixers can be installed through the cover or walls of the digester. Substantial mixing can be effected with about-5-8 watts/m3 of digester contents. Internal gas mixing types normally used for digesters are: The injection of a large sludge gas bubble at the bottom of a 30 cm diameter tube to create piston pumping action and periodic surface agitation The injection of sludge gas sequentially through a series of lances suspended from the digester covers to as great a depth as possible, depending on cover movement",

The first method generally has a low power requirement and consequently, produces only a low level of mixing. As a result, the major benefit derived from its use is in scum control. Lance free gas lift, and draft tube gas mixing, however, can be scaled to induce strong mixing of the digester contents. The circulation patterns produced by these two mixing methods differ. In the free gas lift system, the gas bubble velocity at the bottom of the tank is zero, accelerating to a maximum as the bubble reaches the liquid surface. Since the pumping action of the gas is directly related to the velocity of the bubble, there is no pumping from the bottom of the tank with a free gas lift system. In contrast, a draft tube acts as a gas lift pump which, by the law of continuity, causes the flow of sludge entering the bottom of the draft tube to be the same as that exiting at the top",

The significance of this difference is that draft tube mixers induce bottom currents to prevent or at least reduce accumulations of settleable material. Another difference among internal gas mixing systems is that the gas injection devices in a free gas lift system are fixed on the bottom of the digester and thus cannot be removed for cleaning without draining the tank. To reduce clogging problems, provisions should be made for flushing the gas lines and diffusers with high pressure water. With the lance and draft tube systems, the gas diffusers are inserted from the roof and, therefore, can lie withdrawn for cleaning without removing the contents of the tank. A drawback in these systems, though, is that the draft tube and gas lines suspended inside the tank may foul with rags and debris contained in the digesting sludge",

The flow field within the equipment is simulated and flow patterns, velocities, residence time distributions, additive blend times, pressure drops and other relevant parameters can be determined.

The gas holders may be of the following types: 1) A bell shaped cylindrical tank submerged in water installed either on the top of a digester or as a separate unit. The structure holding the water may be made of RCC. As the gas enters or leaves, the holder rises or falls. 2) A pontoon cover type which floats on the liquid content of the digester consisting of steel ceiling, skirt plates, a gas dome and steel trusses 3) Dry type gas holder consisting of a cylindrical steel tank in which a disc-shaped piston makes contact at its periphery with the inside of the tank. The gas enters the 6-40 holder from beneath the piston which floats on the gas",

In terms of relative comparison, the biological system has least residues but has to be maintained and managed carefully for the thiobacillus biomass to be maintained with respect to its nutrient requirements and the avoiding of the media getting too much growth thereon and getting clogged. The bio-chemical system uses the porous rashik rings and to that extent, its excessive growth and clogging is a matter of concern and nutrient addition is also to be maintained. The recovery of elemental sulphur as for example if the raw sewage has a SO4 concentration of say 300 mg/l, the elemental Sulphur recovery even at 100% can be about 100 kg/MLD, but the aspects of its purity and consistent yield from an STP are to be critically rated.

Some horizontal screw press systems (e.g., the combined dewatering and pasteurization process) include a rotary screen thickener before the screw press, which may be desirable for reducing the hydraulic load to the screw press given certain feed sludge characteristics in conventional applications. A screw press is a simple, slow moving device that achieves continuous dewatering. Polymer is combined with sludge in flocculation vessels upstream of the screw press to enhance the sludge’s dewatering characteristics. Screw presses dewater sludge first by gravity drainage at the inlet section of the screw and then by squeezing free water out of the sludge as they are conveyed to the discharge end of the screw under gradually increasing pressure and friction. The increased pressure to compress the sludge is generated by progressively reducing the available cross-sectional area for the sludge. The released water is allowed to escape through perforated",

The moisture of the filtered cake varies normally from 80% in case of raw activated sludge to 70% for digested primary sludge. Filters should be operated to produce a cake of 60 to 70% moisture if it is to be heated, dried or incinerated. At the end of each filter run, the filter fabric is cleaned to remove sticking sludge. A high pressure stream of water is used to clean the filter cloth. The filters are usually located in a separate room or building with adequate light and ventilation.",

When surplus gas exists in large amounts, the energy possessed by the gas can be effectively utilized and energy savings can be achieved in the entire system. When considering the effective utilization of this unused energy, if there is a demand for heat for direct use such as auxiliary fuel for incinerating sludge, fuel for boiler (for hot water supply, for cooling and heating), a simple and highly efficient system is preferable.

When digester gas obtained from anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludge is to be used for power generation, siloxane included in minute quantities in the digester gas sticks to the internal surface of cylinders and gas engine plugs causing accidents due to misfiring and abnormal ignition; therefore, measures against siloxane need to be adopted. Silicone, which is the source from which siloxane is generated, is included in major proportion in shampoo and rinse used in the bathroom.

Other policies for effective energy utilization are fuel cells, microgas turbine power generation, and automotive fuel gas applications, which have been practically realized. The features of fuel cell are its high efficiency and no rotating parts. Thus, there is no noise, operation and maintenance are easy, and exhaust is also clean.

But then, in the Lime addition in the chemical system, the flow rate should be necessarily uniform to facilitate dosing of chemical uniformly. This implied flow equalization necessarily at some point. It was decided to have this before the biological treatment itself so that the dosage of Sodium bicarbonate whenever needed (before the primary clarifier to ensure adequate bicarbonate alkalinity for biological nitrification in the aeration tank) can be controlled easily in a steady state and which will avoid unduly high Sodium in the resulting sewage",

Hence it was all the more necessary for upfront equalization. Before feeding to the RO plant, the foulants like ammonia and phosphorous had to be removed. For this purpose, ammonia removal options of high lime induced air stripping, biological nitrification, chlorination and Clinoptinolite resin exchange were evaluated and it was decided to follow the biological nitrification route given its high degree of reliability and the fact that nitrates can be rejected in the RO and residual presence in permeate was not prohibited.",

The desired cooling water makeup needed a quality where Silica was to be restricted to less than 3 mg/l. The raw sewage Silica content was about 38 mg/l. The Magnesium content was 180 mg/l at the minimum. This when precipitated at pH above 10.5, will reduce Mg to less than 25 mg/l. Thus Mg removal could be 155 mg/l. This can co-precipitate Silica by 155 / 5 = 31 mg/l which meets the requirement of Silica removal before entering RO to less than 5 mg/l and by restricting the recovery at about 75%, the Silica in the permeate can be held down to 1 mg/l and reject Silica can well be about 20 mg/l",

Though this was dissolved into bicarbonate in the second stage carbonation, at times this was difficult and the neutralization was switched over to use of hydrochloric acid. This increased the Calcium content in feed to RO and required readjustments of the blending to peg the TDS in the product water. The use of a solids contact clarifier instead of the plain clarifier could have been a better choice but the possibility of the Calcium carbonate sludge solidifying therein and choking the sludge withdrawal lines were the other issues. Conventional precipitation of Ca and Mg could have been tried instead of high lime carbonation, but the fact that phosphorous even at 0.1 mg/l prevents solids liquid separation of the precipitated carbonate and thus defeating the objective was the reason.

A combination of high lime and UF would perhaps be the best available technology. In respect of the sludge cake, the wet biological sludge from the filter press machines, was blended with the high Lime precipitated sludge and the cake was further treated to raise the pH of the same to about 9.3 by a paddle mixer and the resulting sludge mass is being used to raise the low lying areas and serves as a secure land fill in the clayey soil.

The main purpose of the GWRS remains the recharge of the aquifer: it will be able to supply about 22% of the water needed to recharge the Orange County groundwater basin in the year 2020, which is forecasted to reach over 500 million m3/y. Groundwater recharge will limit seawater intrusion and thus improve regional water quality by lowering salinity in the water supply, especially since this high quality water contains less dissolved solids than imported water from the Colorado River.

Research projects have been carried out there on the heat island mitigation by sprinkling reclaimed wastewater on roads. Treated wastewater from plants using advanced processes such as biological filtration, ozonation, or microfiltration, is used for spreading on the roads (Yamagata, et al, 2008). It was observed that sprinkling treated wastewater on water retentive pavement decreased the road surface temperature by 8 degrees during the daytime and by 3 degrees at night and the road surface temperature was decreased to same level as that on planting zones.

Typical guidelines for cooling water quality are given in Table 7.12 and may be used where specific requirements are not given. To determine the quality and quantity of water required for reuse in a cooling system, where an open recirculating system is adopted for air conditioning cooling water, the amount of water to be kept recirculating in the system is approximately 11 litres/min for every ton of refrigeration capacity when the temperature drop is 5°C in the cooling tower. For such a situation, the water lost in evaporation (E) is about 1% of the recirculating water. Windage loss (W) is of the order of 0.1 to 0.3% of the recirculating water when mechanical draft towers are used, but increases to 0.3 to 1.0% for atmospheric towers",

The assumption is frequently made that in the absence of phenolphthalein alkalinity, the pH of the water leaving the cooling tower will be between 8.0 and 8.3 due to elimination of free carbon dioxide in the tower.

The blending ensures a certain amount of hardness in the water which is useful to protect against corrosion of ferrous heat exchanger surfaces.

Pre-chlorination is done as the water enters the coagulation tanks, while post-chlorination is mainly in the form of periodic “shock” doses to control lime and algal growths.

The net result is if and when the sector gets populated, a massive rehabilitation programme of the sewer system becomes implied often leading to indiscriminate cutting open of the roads. A further difficulty is the STP which is grossly underutilized and the treated sewage quality suffers due to prolonged hydraulic retention",

Duncan Mara defines simplified sewerage as “An off-site sanitation technology that removes all wastewater from the household environment.” Conceptually it is the same as conventional sewerage, but with conscious efforts made to eliminate unnecessarily conservative design features and to match design standards to the local situation. The simplified sewerage approach is now widely used through Brazil as an in-block system as in Figure 8.4 rather than – as with conventional sewerage – an in-road system. 15605 The key feature of an in-block system is that sewers are routed in private land, through either back or front yards",

The minimum allowable sewer diameter is 100 mm, rather than the 150 mm or more that is normally required for conventional sewerage.

In a pour flush latrine, as the name suggests, excreta is hand flushed by pouring about 1.5 to 2.0 litres of water. These pour-flush leaching pit latrines were first developed in India in mid-forties with a single leach pit and squatting pan placed over it. When the pit in use gets filled up another pit is dug and the squatting slab is removed and placed over the new pit. The first pit is covered with earth and the excreta is allowed to digest. After one or two years, the digested excreta is used as manure. In late fifties, a modified design off-set system was developed.

In a single pit system, desludging has to be done almost immediately after the pit has been filled up to enable its re- use; this involves handling of fresh and undigested excreta containing pathogens - a health hazard. Single leach pit is appropriate only if it is desludged mechanically by a vacuum tanker. To overcome this shortcoming, the Twin-pit design was introduced and in this case when one pit is full, the excreta is diverted to the second pit. The filled up pit can be conveniently emptied after 1.5 to 2 years, when most of the pathogens die off. The sludge can safely be used as manure. Thus the two pits can be used alternately and perpetually. With simple care, pour-flush water-seal latrine is a very satisfactory and hygienic sanitation system and hence it can be located inside the house since the water-seal prevents odour and insect nuisance.",

All these studies have proved that when the septic tank is not desludged for a longer period i.e., more than the design period, substantial portion of solids escape with the effluent. Therefore for the septic tank to be an efficient suspended solids remover, it should be of sufficient capacity with proper inlet and outlet arrangements.

The microbial growth is retained on the stone media making possible higher loading rates and efficient digestion. The capacity of the unit is 0.04 to 0.05 m3 per capita or 1/3 to 1/2 the liquid capacity of the septic tank it serves. BOD removals of 70% can be expected. The effluent is clear and free from Odour. This unit has several advantages viz, (a) a high degree of stabilization; (b) little sludge production; (c) low capital and operating cost; and (d) low loss of head in the filter (10 to 15 cm) in normal operation.

Anaerobic filter system An anaerobic filter is a fixed-bed biological reactor.

Anaerobic filters are widely used as secondary treatment in household black- or grey water systems and to improve the solid removal compared to septic tanks or anaerobic baffled reactors. Since anaerobic filters work by anaerobic digestion, they can be designed as anaerobic digesters allowing recovering the produced biogas. Multi-chamber septic tank system prevents sludge carryover.",

Many situations such as presence of rocky ground, highly permeable soil and high groundwater table does not allow the construction of soak pits. In such cases, it is often a common practice to discharge effluent directly into an open drain causing surface water pollution. Another disadvantage of septic tank is its incapability to handle hydraulic shock loads, as peak flow disturbs the settling zone and causes high suspended solids in the effluent. One of the recommended solutions is the provision of anaerobic filter type system for the treatment of septic tank effluent (MOUD, 2008)",

Advantages Since package-type treatment equipment can be fully manufactured in a factory, quality control of the product is easy and the price can be reduced due to a mass production effect. A treatment system for home use (5 to 10 persons) requires an area of 3 to 5 m2; that is to say, it is a compact system. Moreover, when it is installed underground, the space above can be used for several purposes such as a garage. This system, being a product manufactured in a factory, does not require complicated work on site during installation, so the installation time is short (about one week). Accordingly, it can improve environmental sanitation quickly.

At the same time, if the spare capacity is available, it is wiser to opt for this instead of rushing into a dedicated septage treatment facility.

States will need to determine time-frames and deadlines to achieve the goals mentioned in the NUSP and will need to spell out a detailed roadmap, including the incremental targets for achievement of goals. For example, to achieve the goal of open defecation free (ODF) by year 2013, a detailed plan for extending access will need to be formulated and implemented in a time-bound manner.

In such cases, interim (e.g. on-site, or community septic tanks, improved septic tanks, Johkaso, or latrines if space is a constraint) systems may be planned with a view to later upgrade these to more sophisticated system (e.g. sewerage).

Topics addressed in the CMP include the City’s goals and objectives, land use plan, urban design, housing, infrastructure, parks, open space, transportation, economic development and preservation of historical monuments. The CMP is constantly under revision as the needs of the community change and state or Urban Local body requirements are incorporated into the document",

The planning period of CMP is a function of various developmental plans as stated above and should be fairly of a longer period for sustainability of other development plans. In order to have sustainable CMP and other developmental plans there is a need for inter and intra departmental coordination of central and state departments including parastatal agencies. From the standpoint of the direction and overall needs of National Government, a CSP is one among several functional plans, such as those dealing with highways, natural resources, education, health, etc. CSP, therefore, should relate to, and not conflict with, other plans of the city. It is essential that the city sanitation planning be included in the overall plan of the jurisdiction that will ultimately implement it",

The data needed to design the SEWER network are pipe lengths, diameters, nodal demands, ground levels of the nodes, other design constraints such as peak factor, minimum and maximum allowable velocities, Manning's coefficient, maximum cover depth, outfall nodal demand, ground elevations, number of nodes, links etc. The programme assumes linear ground profiles between the nodes.

Five numbers of differently aged sewage pumping mains of Chennai sewerage system were selected and the hydraulics were evaluated using Rhodamine B Fluorescent tracer dyes injected into the pump deliveries and the concentrations were measured with a fluorometer at the start and discharge of the pumping mains and related to the measured flows, diameter and length of the pipe lines which were all Cast Iron mains with spigot socket lead joints. The study was aimed to establish the velocity profiles, siltation in the pumping mains and the resulting friction co-efficient. All the pumping mains were low lift pumping stations and hence the Manning’s n was selected as the criteria of friction factor evaluation",

The Physical Setting and Methodology The sandy soils in the area coupled with the local practice of scouring cooking pots with sand contribute to the inordinate quantities of grit and silt found in Madras sewage. This phenomenon was recognized by Madeley, and his investigations conducted in the early 1900’s led to the construction of degritting wells ahead of the major pump stations which however were mostly non-operational. As part of the present investigations, tests were conducted at five of the pump stations. Static head and friction losses were measured at several flows with dual pressure gauges immediately downstream from the pump station manifold. Flows were measured by using a Turner fluorometer and standardized solutions of Rhodamine “B” dye",

Flow rates were computed from the observed dilution of the standard fluorescent dye solution. The results of these tests are presented in Table 7. The measurements of flow, total head and static head are given in columns (1) to (3). The dynamic head column (4) is the difference between the total and static heads. Column (5) shows the calculated flow velocities. The “K” value in column (6) is equal to Δhd/Q 2. The Manning’s roughness coefficient, n, was calculated from the Manning equation: Q RnA / 3/2 d Lh / 2/1 Examination of Table 7 shows that the calculated K and n values change with flow and velocity.

Hydraulic theory dictates that there are only two possible causes for this phenomenon, either the basic relation changes or the cross sectional area of the pipe and / or the roughness of its interior change. Dr Walter L Moore discussed the first of these possibilities in his 1959 ASCE paper entitled “Relationships between pipe resistance formulas”, where it was shown that the friction loss constant K, does increase slightly as the flow is reduced towards the point where the laminar flow regime begins. To account for this phenomenon, Dr Moore developed a procedure for varying the exponent “m” as a function of the Reynolds Number and, thereby, allowing K to remain constant.",

Larger lines will fill; up with silt until a scour velocity is reached and then produce the friction losses commensurate with the smaller equivalent pipe. Fourthly, force mains which have been operated at reasonably high velocities exhibit a friction loss coefficient “n” when clean similar to that of smooth wrought iron pipe. Evidently, the larger quantities of grit transported through these lines has polished their interiors. In fact Greams road force main was apparently so thoroughly polished that it responded hydraulically like a smooth brass or glass pipeline. It was therefore concluded that a friction loss co-efficient of 0.0125 is more representative of the Madras Force mains than the normally accepted values for new cast iron of 0.013. iron of 0.013",

This historical record establishes the need to ensure (a) adequate grit removal before pumping and adequate non silting velocities in the design stage itself as otherwise, like the mains reported herein, the siltation may be severely restraining the pumping main capacities in the years to come and especially in locations where the densification of population is very slow in newer habitations and eventually when the population does pick up to designed capacity, the pumping mains would have been severely choked calling for radical “cut and cure” techniques. By a similar argument, the same can also happen to the gravity sewer collection pipes also and it will not be easy to “cut and cure” such gravity sewers. The study also advances a case effectively on the need for incremental sewerage and non conventional options as in chapter-3 especially in the case of newer layouts.",

No increased risk of hookworm infection was detected when wastewater with a mean concentration of 15 ova per litre was used, which would suggest that at least for the risk of hookworm infection, the WHO nematode guideline is too strict and that a more lenient guideline can be set if hookworm species is the predominant ova in wastewater. However, more studies are needed to confirm this suggestion.",

If treatment is not possible because of the high costs, other protective measures should be taken.

Therefore, buildings being retrofitted for flush toilets and the construction of new buildings offer excellent opportunities for reuse. Initially, the country’s reuse program provided reclaimed water to multi-family, commercial, and school buildings, with a reclamation plant treating all of the wastewater for use in toilet flushing and other incidental nonpotable purposes. Later, municipal treatment works and reclaimed water systems were used together, as part of a dual system, providing more effective and economical treatment than individual reclamation",

A wide variety of buildings were fitted for reclaimed water use, with schools and office buildings being most numerous. In Tokyo, the use of reclaimed water is mandated in all new buildings that have floor area larger than 30,000 m2. Japan offers a very good reuse model for cities in developing countries because its historical usage is directly related to meeting urban water needs rather than only agricultural irrigation requirements.

Before the actual readings for percolation tests are taken, it is necessary to ensure that the soil is given ample opportunity to swell and approach the condition it will be in during the wettest season of the year, This is done by pouring water in the hole upto a minimum depth of 30 cm over the grave! and allowed to soak for 24 hours. If the water remains in the test hole after the overnight swelling period, the depth of water shall be adjusted to 15 cm over the gravel. Then from a fixed reference point, the drop in water level shall be noted over a 30 min, period. This drop shall be used to calculate the percolation rate. If no water remains in the hole, at the end of 30 min. period, water shall be added to bring the depth of the water in hole 15 cm over the gravel. From a fixed reference point, the drop in water level shall be measured at 30 min, intevals for 4 hours, refilling to 15 cm level over the grave! as necessary.
