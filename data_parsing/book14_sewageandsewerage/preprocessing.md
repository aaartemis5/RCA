    Initial Goal & Tool Selection:

        Objective: Extract text and structure from a PDF manual ("Manual on Sewerage and Sewage Treatment Engineering") to build a knowledge base for a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) RAG system.

        Chosen Tool: unstructured[pdf] was selected for its ability to handle various PDF types (selectable text, potentially scanned via OCR) and its layout-aware partitioning.

    Setup & Dependency Handling:

        Challenge: Encountered difficulties installing unstructured[pdf] due to complex dependencies (like ONNX for advanced layout analysis) causing long install times and build failures.

        Solution: Simplified the setup by installing only the core unstructured library and pytesseract (for potential future OCR needs), confirming this was sufficient for the immediate task with selectable text PDFs. Avoided heavier optional dependencies for now. Moved to Google Colab for easier environment management.

    Chunking Strategy Evolution:

        Need: Break down the extracted PDF content into smaller, meaningful chunks suitable for embedding and retrieval.

        Attempt 1 (Discussed): Splitting each unstructured element (paragraph, list item, etc.) individually. Problem: Led to very small, potentially context-poor chunks from short elements.

        Attempt 2 (Implemented): Section-Based Chunking. The key refinement was to group text based on semantic sections identified by 'Title' elements found by unstructured. The process became:

            Identify 'Title' elements as section boundaries.

            Accumulate all the text (NarrativeText, ListItem, etc.) between one title and the next.

            Apply RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to the entire accumulated text of that section to create chunks of appropriate size (CHUNK_SIZE, CHUNK_OVERLAP) while trying to respect sentence/paragraph breaks within the section.

    ID Generation:

        Initial: Used random UUIDs (uuid.uuid4()) for simplicity and guaranteed uniqueness.

        Refinement: Switched to a structured ID schema (doc_pgX_secY_chunkZ) for better traceability and to enable sorting later.

    Performance Optimization & Feedback:

        Challenge: Processing a large (700+ page) PDF sequentially could be slow and lack feedback.

        Solution: Implemented a script using ThreadPoolExecutor to process the identified sections in parallel after the initial PDF parsing. Added tqdm for progress bars during section processing. Incorporated explicit garbage collection (gc.collect()) to help manage memory.

    Output Format & Incremental Progress:

        Challenge: Parallel processing outputs chunks in a non-sequential order. How to monitor progress during the long run?

        Initial Flawed Idea: Page-level batching (processing PDF in chunks of pages). Problem: Broke section integrity crucial for the chunking strategy.

        Revised Solution:

            Parse all relevant pages once (first_page, last_page in partition_pdf).

            Identify all sections.

            Process sections in parallel.

            Write the resulting chunks incrementally to a JSON Lines (.jsonl) file as each section finished processing. This provided progress feedback (file size grows) and used a standard format for large data.

    Post-Processing (Cleaning, Filtering, Ordering - Final Script):

        Challenge: The initial .jsonl output, while capturing section content, still contained unwanted artifacts and was unordered.

        Solution: Created a separate post-processing script to read the generated .jsonl file and perform final cleanup:

            Filtering (Front Matter): Discarded chunks with page_number less than the specified START_CONTENT_PAGE (e.g., 34) to remove TOC, abbreviations lists, etc.

            Filtering (Bad Headings): Discarded chunks whose cleaned heading matched specific patterns (e.g., "table of contents").

            Cleaning (Footers): Removed the recurring "Final Draft" phrase (case-insensitive) from the text_to_embed field.

            Cleaning (Headings): Removed the "Final Draft" phrase (case-insensitive) from the metadata.heading field (setting it to None if the phrase was the only content).

            Sorting: Sorted the remaining valid chunks based on page_number, then section_index and chunk_index (parsed from the structured ID).

            Formatting: Wrote the final, cleaned, filtered, and sorted list of chunks to a standard, pretty-printed .json file (_CLEANED_ORDERED.json) for improved readability and readiness for the next stage.

Final Output:

The result is a well-structured JSON file containing cleaned, ordered chunks of text, each associated with relevant metadata (source, page, heading), optimized for ingestion into your Pinecone vector database to power the RAG system.
