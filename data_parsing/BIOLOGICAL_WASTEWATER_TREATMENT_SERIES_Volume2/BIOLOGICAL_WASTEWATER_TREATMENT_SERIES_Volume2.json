These biological processes reproduce, in a certain way, the natural processes that take place in a water body after a wastewater discharge. In a water body, organic matter is converted into inert mineralised products by purely natural mechanisms, characterising the self-puriﬁcation phenomenon. In a wastewater treatment plant the same basic phenomena occur, but the difference is that there is the introduction of technology. This technology has the objective of making the puriﬁcation process develop under controlled conditions (operational control) and at higher rates (more compact solution). The understanding of the microbiology of sewage treatment is therefore es- sential for the optimisation of the design and operation of biological treatment systems. In the past, engineers designed the treatment works based essentially on empirical criteria. In the last few decades, the multidisciplinary character of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering has been recognised, and the biologists have brought fundamental contributions for the understanding of the process. The rational knowledge has expanded, together with the decrease in the level of em- piricism, allowing the systems to be designed and operated with a more solid base. The result has brought an increase in the efﬁciency and a reduction in the costs. The main organisms involved in sewage treatment are bacteria, protozoa, fungi, algae and worms. Their characterisation is presented in Section 1.2. This chapter also covers sewage treatment from a biological and ecological (study of the com- munities involved) points of view. Recognising the great importance of the bacteria in the conversion process of the organic matter, a more detailed description of them is given in the present chapter.",

Recognising the great importance of the bacteria in the conversion process of the organic matter, a more detailed description of them is given in the present chapter. 1.2 MICROORGANISMS PRESENT IN WATER AND WASTEWATER Microbiology is the branch of biology that deals with microorganisms. In terms of water quality, the microorganisms play an essential role, due to their large predomi- nance in certain environments, their action in wastewater puriﬁcation processes and their association with water borne diseases. Microorganisms can only be observed microscopically. Some microorganism groups have properties in common with plants whilst others have some animal characteristics. In the past, the classiﬁcation of liv- ing creatures used to be according to the two main kingdoms, Plants and Ani- mals, and the microorganisms were present in each of these two large subdivi- sions. Subsequently, however, biologists have adopted a more practical division, plac- ing microorganisms in the separate kingdoms of the Monera (simpler creatures, without a separate nucleus, such as bacteria, cyanobacteria and archaea) and the Protists (simple creatures, but with a separate nucleus, such as algae, fungi and protozoa). There are still other possible subdivisions into other kingdoms, but these are not important for the objectives of this book. The basic difference between the monera/protists and the other organisms (plants and animals) is the high level of cellular differentiation found in the plants and animals. This means that, in monera and protist organisms, the cells of a single individual are morphologically and functionally similar, which reduces its adaptation and development capacity. However, in organisms with cellular differ- entiation, a functional division occurs. In the higher organisms, the differentiated cells (generally of the same type) combine into larger or smaller groups, called tis- sue. The tissues constitute the organs (e.g. lungs), and these form the systems (e.g. respiratory system). The level of cellular differentiation is therefore an indication of the developmental level of a species. Table 1.1 presents the basic characteristics of the kingdoms in the living world, while Table 1.2 lists the main characteristics of the various groups that comprise the monera and protist kingdoms. Protists have the nucleus of the cell conﬁned by a nuclear membrane (algae, protozoa and fungi), being characterised eukaryotes. Monera have the nucleus disseminated in the protoplasm (bacteria, cyanobacteria and",

A short description of their main components is presented below (La Rivi´ere, 1980; Tchobanoglous & Schroeder, 1985). The cells generally have as an external boundary a cell membrane. This mem- brane is ﬂexible and functions as a selective barrier between what is contained inside the cell and the external environment. The membrane is semi-permeable and therefore exerts an important role in selecting the substances that can leave or enter the cell. However, bacteria, algae, fungi, and plants have yet another external layer called cell wall. This is generally composed of a rigid material that gives structural form to the cell, even offering protection against mechanical impacts and osmotic alterations. It is believed that this wall is not semi-permeable and therefore does not exert a role in the regulation of the consumption of dissolved substances in the surrounding medium. In some bacteria the cell wall can even be involved by another external layer, generally of a gelatinous material, called capsule (with deﬁned limits) or gelatinous layer (when diffused). In the case that the individual cells present motility, they usually have ﬂagella or cilia. The interior of the cell contains organelles and a colloidal suspension of pro- teins, carbohydrates and other complex forms of organic matter, constituting the cytoplasm. Each cell contains nucleic acids, a genetic material vital for reproduction. Ri- bonucleic acid (RNA) is important for the synthesis of proteins and is found in",

Ri- bonucleic acid (RNA) is important for the synthesis of proteins and is found in the ribosome present in the cytoplasm. The prokaryotic cells, such as those from bacteria, contain only a nuclear area, while the eukaryotic cells have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane. The nucleus (or nuclear area) is rich in deoxyri- bonucleic acids (DNA), which contain the genetic information necessary for the reproduction of all the cell components. The cytoplasm of the prokaryotic cells frequently contains DNA in small structures called plasmids. A simpliﬁed schematic representation of a bacterial cell is presented in Figure 1.1. 1.4 ENERGY AND CARBON SOURCES FOR MICROBIAL CELLS All living creatures need (a) energy (b) carbon and (c) nutrients (nitrogen, phos- phorus, sulphur, potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc.) for functions of growth, locomotion, reproduction and others. In terms of the carbon source, there are two fundamental organism types: • Autotrophic organisms. Carbon source: carbon dioxide (CO2); • Heterotrophic organisms. Carbon source: organic matter. In terms of the energy source, there are two basic organism types: • Phototrophic organisms. Energy source: light; • Chemotrophicorganisms.Energysource: energy from chemical reactions. The combinations between these four types are shown in Table 1.3.

In most of the sewage treatment processes (with the exception of facultative and maturation ponds), light does not penetrate signiﬁcantly in the liquid contained in the biological reactors, due to the high turbidity of the liquid. Because of this, the presence of microorganisms that have light as energy sources (photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs) is extremely limited. Therefore, the organisms of real im- portance in this case are the chemoautotrophs (responsible, for example, for ni- triﬁcation) and the chemoheterotrophs (responsible for most of the reactions that occur in biological treatment). For simplicity, the latter ones will be subsequently named only heterotrophs. 1.5 METABOLISM OF MICROORGANISMS The chemical processes that simultaneously take place in the cell are jointly called metabolism, and can be divided into two categories (La Rivi´ere, 1980): • Dissimilation or catabolism: reactions of energy production, in which sub- strate decomposition occurs; • Assimilation or anabolism: reactions that lead to the formation of cellular material (growth), using the energy released in the dissimilation. In a simpliﬁed way,the organisms grow and reproduce themselves at the expense of the energy released in the dissimilation. In dissimilation, the energy stored in chemical form in the organic compounds (substrate) is released and converted in the assimilation in cellular material. The net growth is the result of the balance between the anabolism (positive) and the catabolism (negative). In both categories, the chemical transformations occur in a sequence of diverse and intricate intermediate reactions, each catalysed by a speciﬁc type of enzyme. Most of the enzymes are located inside the cell: these are called intracellular enzymes or endoenzymes. However, some enzymes are released in the external medium and are designated as extracellular enzymes or exoenzymes. Their impor- tance is associated with the fact that they lead to hydrolysis reactions outside the cell, in the liquid medium, converting large and complex substrate molecules into smaller and simpler molecules, which can then pass through the cell membrane to become available for consumption by the cell.",

The removal of the organic matter from sewage occurs through the process of dissimilation or catabolism. The two types of catabolism of interest in sewage treatment are oxidative catabolism (oxidation of the organic matter) and fermen- tative catabolism (fermentation of the organic matter) (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994): • Oxidative catabolism: redox reaction in which an oxidising agent present in the medium (oxygen, nitrate or sulphate) oxidises the organic matter. • Fermentative catabolism: there is no oxidant. The process occurs due to the rearrangement of the electrons in the fermented molecule in such a way that at least two products are formed. Generally, there is the need of various fermentation sequences for the products to be stabilised, that is, be no longer susceptible to fermentation. The main characteristics of the oxidative and fermentative catabolism are pre- sented in Table 1.4. The concept of electron acceptor is explained in Section 1.6. 1.6 ENERGY GENERATION IN MICROBIAL CELLS As seen in Section 1.5, the generation of energy in the microbial cells can be accomplished, depending on the microorganism, by means of respiration (oxidative catabolism) or fermentation (fermentative catabolism). The name respiration is not restricted to the processes that involve oxygen con- sumption. In general, oxidation implies the loss of one or more electrons from the oxidisedsubstance(inoxidation,thesubstancegivesinnegativechargesintheform of electrons when passing to a higher oxidation state). The oxidised substance can be the organic matter, as well as reduced inorganic compounds – both are therefore electron donors. The electrons taken from the oxidised molecule are transferred through complicated biochemical reactions with the help of enzymes to another inorganic compound (oxidising agent), which receives the generic denomination",

The electrons taken from the oxidised molecule are transferred through complicated biochemical reactions with the help of enzymes to another inorganic compound (oxidising agent), which receives the generic denomination of electron acceptor. As a result, the electron acceptor has its oxidation state reduced. The main electron acceptors used in respiration are listed in Table 1.5 in a decreasing order of energy release. When various electron acceptors are available in the medium, the microorgan- isms use the one that produces the highest quantity of energy. For this reason, the dissolved oxygen is used ﬁrst and, after it is exhausted, the system stops being aerobic. If there is nitrate available in the liquid medium (which is not always the case), the organisms that are capable of using nitrate in their respiration start to do it, converting the nitrate to nitrogen gas (denitriﬁcation). These conditions receive an speciﬁc name, being designated as anoxic (absence of dissolved oxygen but presence of nitrates). When the nitrates are ﬁnished, strict anaerobic conditions occur. In these, sulphates are used and reduced to sulphides, and carbon dioxide is converted into methane. While there are substances with greater energy release, the other ones are not used (Arceivala, 1981). The methanogenesis stage can occur in two pathways. The ﬁrst is the oxidative process of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (production of methane from hydrogen), in which carbon dioxide acts as an electron acceptor and is reduced to methane. This pathway is less important in terms of the global conversion, but can be made by practically all methanogenic organisms. The second pathway is acetotrophic methanogenesis (production of methane from acetate), in which the organic carbon, in the form of acetate (acetic acid) is converted into methane. This pathway is responsible for most of the conversions, although it is accomplished by few bacteria species (Lubberding, 1995). There are organisms that are functionally adapted to the various respiration conditions. The main ones are: • Strict aerobic organisms: use only free oxygen in their respiration • Facultative organisms: use free oxygen (preferably) or nitrate as electron acceptors • Strict anaerobic organisms: use sulphate or carbon dioxide as electron acceptors and cannot obtain energy through aerobic respiration",

Because of the reproduc- tion rate of the aerobic organisms being greater, the sludge generation is also greater. The main reactions for the generation of energy that occur in aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic conditions are: • Aerobic conditions: C6H12O6 + 6 O2 -------------> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O (1.1) • Anoxic conditions: nitrate reduction (denitriﬁcation) 2 NO3 −+ 2 H+ -------------> N2 + 2,5 O2 + H2O (1.2) • Anaerobic conditions: sulphate reduction CH3COOH + SO4 2−+ 2 H+ -------------> H2S + 2 H2O + 2 CO2 (1.3) • Anaerobic conditions: CO2 reduction (hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis) 4 H2 + CO2 -------------> CH4 + 2 H2O (1.4) • Anaerobic conditions: acetotrophic methanogenesis CH3COOH -------------> CH4 + CO2 (1.5) Figure 1.2 illustrates the main routes of organic matter decomposition in the presence of different electron acceptors. The sequence of transformations that occurs in sewage treatment is a function of the electron acceptor and the oxidation state of the compounds, measured by its oxidation–reduction potential (expressed in millivolts). Figure 1.3 illustrates these reactions. The oxidation state of the compound determines the maximum quantity of energy available through it. The more reduced the compound, the more energy it contains. The objective of the energetic metabolism is to conserve as much energy as possible in a form available for a cell. The maximum energy available from the oxidation of a substrate is the difference between its energetic content (given by the oxidation state) and the energetic content of the ﬁnal products of the reaction (also given by their oxidation state at the end of the reaction) (Grady and Lim, 1980).",

The following points apply: • The greater the oxidation state of the ﬁnal product, the greater the energy release. The carbon in CO2 is at its higher state of oxidation. Therefore oxidation reactions that oxidise the carbon in the substrate completely to CO2 (aerobic respiration) release more energy than the reactions that produce, for example, ethanol (fermentation). • The lower the oxidation state of the substrate, the greater the energy release. For instance, the oxidation of acetic acid to CO2 releases less energy than the oxidation of ethanol to CO2, because the carbon in the acetic acid is at a higher oxidation state than in ethanol. • CO2 can never act as an energy source, because its carbon is at the highest possible state of oxidation (CO2 cannot be oxidised). 1.7 ECOLOGY OF BIOLOGICAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT 1.7.1 Introduction The role played by microorganisms in sewage treatment depends on the process being used. In facultative ponds, algae have a fundamental function related to the production of oxygen by photosynthesis. The design of ponds is done in such a way as to optimise the presence of algae in the liquid medium and to obtain an adequate balance between bacteria and algae. In anaerobic treatment systems, the conditions are favourable or even exclusive for the development of microorganisms functionally adapted to the absence of oxygen. In this case, the acidogenic and methanogenic organisms are essential. The microbial mass involved in the aerobic processes consists mainly of bacteria and protozoa. Other organisms, such as fungi and rotifers, can also be found, but their importance is lower. The capacity of fungi to survive in reduced pH ranges and with little nitrogen makes them important in the treatment of certain industrial wastewaters. However, fungi with a ﬁlamentous structure can deteriorate the sludge settleability, thus reducing the efﬁciency of the process. Rotifers are efﬁcient in the consumption of dispersed bacteria and small particles of organic matter. Their presence in the efﬂuent indicates an efﬁcient biological puriﬁcation process (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991). Generally, it can be said that the species diversity of the various microorganisms in the biomass is low. Figure 1.4 presents a sequence of the relative predominance of the main mi- croorganisms involved in aerobic sewage treatment. The ecological interactions in the microbial community cause the increase in the population of a group of microorganisms to be followed by the",

Immediately after the introduction of sewage into the biological reactor, the remaining BOD (organic matter) is at its maximum level. The number of bacteria is still reduced, and pro- tozoa of the amoeba type can be found. These are inefﬁcient in the competition for the available food, being found mainly at the start-up of reactors. Due to the great availability of the substrate, the bacterial population grows. The amoebas are then substituted by ﬂagellated protozoa that, due to their motility, are more efﬁcient in the competition for the available food. These ﬂagellated protozoa are characteristic of high load systems. With the passing of time and the decrease of the available organic matter, ciliate protozoa substitute the ﬂagellated ones, since the former are capable of surviving with lower food concentrations. This point characterises the operation of conventional load systems, where a large number of free-living ciliates are present together with the maximum number of bacteria and a low concentration of organic matter (remaining BOD). In long retention periods, which are characteristic of low load systems, the available organic matter is at a minimum and the bacteria are consumed by ciliates and rotifers (K¨onig, 1990). The sections below describe the two main groups involved in the conversion of organic matter: bacteria and protozoa, with greater emphasis being given to the ﬁrst group. 1.7.2 Bacteria Bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic (absence of a deﬁned nucleus) microorganisms that live isolated or in colonies.

The classiﬁcation of bacteria according to the shape includes the categories listed in Table 1.6. The bacteria have a more or less rigid cell wall and may or may not present ﬂagella for locomotion. Their reproduction is principally by binary ﬁssion, besides the formation of spores and sexual reproduction (minority) (Branco, 1976; Metcalf & Eddy, 1991). Bacteria constitute the largest and most important group in biological wastew- ater treatment systems. Considering that the main function of a treatment system is the removal of BOD, the heterotrophic bacteria are the main agents of this mechanism. In addition of playing the role of conversion of the organic matter, the bacteria have the property to agglomerate themselves in structural units such as ﬂocs, bioﬁlms or granules, which have important implications in wastewater treatment (see Section 1.7.4). Besides the removal of the carbonaceous organic matter, sewage treatment can also incorporate other objectives, which depend on speciﬁc groups of bacteria. Thus, the following phenomena can take place: • Conversion of ammonia to nitrite (nitriﬁcation): chemoautotrophic bacteria • Conversion of nitrite to nitrate (nitriﬁcation): chemoautotrophic bacteria • Conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas (denitriﬁcation): facultative chemo- heterotrophic bacteria The cellular structure of bacteria was presented in Section 1.3 and illustrated in Figure 1.1. Approximately 80% of the bacterial cell is composed of water and 20% of dry matter. Of this dry matter, around 90% is organic and 10% inorganic. Widely used formulas for the characterisation of the approximate cell composition are (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991): C5H7O2N (without phosphorus in the formula) C60H87O23N12P (with phosphorus in the formula) In any of the two formulations, the C:H:O:N ratio is the same. An important aspect is that all of these components should be obtained from the medium, and the absence of any of them could limit the growth of the bacterial population. The utilisation by the bacteria of the substrate available in the medium depends on the relative size of the particle.

The two main fractions of the organic matter in the wastewater are (a) easily biodegradable fraction and (b) slowly biodegradable fraction. In a typical domestic sewage, most of the organic matter in soluble form is easily degradable. Owing to their small dimensions, soluble compounds can penetrate the bacterial cell through their cellular membranes. Inside the cell, the soluble organic matter is consumed with the aid of endoenzymes. Organic com- pounds of larger dimensions and more complex formulas (particulate or suspended organic matter), should undergo a transformation process outside the cells, leading to smaller molecules, which can be assimilated by the bacteria. This action is ac- complished with the aid of exoenzymes in a reaction of hydrolysis. In the hydrolysis, energy consumption is not taken into account, and there is no use of electron ac- ceptors. The ﬁnal product of hydrolysis is present in an easily biodegradable form, penetrating through the cellular membrane inside the cell, where it is consumed in a similar way as the soluble matter (IAWPRC, 1987) (see Figure 1.5). The environmental requirements for the bacteria vary with the species. For example, bacteria involved in the nitriﬁcation process (chemoautotrophic bacteria) are much more sensitive to environmental conditions than the usual heterotrophic bacteria involved in the stabilisation of the carbonaceous organic matter. In general, the optimal growth rate for bacterial growth occurs within relatively limited ranges of temperature and pH, even though their survival can occur within much wider ranges. Temperatures below the optimal level have a greater inﬂuence in the growth rate compared to temperatures above the optimal level. Depending on temperature range, bacteria can be classiﬁed as psycrophilic, mesophilic or thermophilic. The typical temperature ranges for each of these categories are presented in Table 1.7. pH is also an important factor in bacterial growth. Most bacteria do not support pH values above 9.5 or below 4.0, and the optimal value is around neutrality (6.5 to 1.5) (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991). 1.7.3 Protozoa Most of the protozoa group comprises unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms with- out a cell wall.

Although they have no cellular differentiation, some have a rela- tively complex structure with some differentiated regions within the cell for the undertaking of different functions. The majority are represented by strictly aerobic or facultative heterotrophic organisms. Their reproduction occurs by binary ﬁssion. Protozoa are usually larger than bacteria and can feed on them. This makes the protozoa group an important level in the food web, allowing that larger organisms feed indirectly on the bacteria, which would otherwise be an inaccessible form of food. Depending on some structural characteristics and on the mode of motility, the protozoa can be divided into various groups. Those of principal interest are the following: amoebas, ﬂagellates and free-swimming and stalked ciliates (Branco, 1976; La Rivi´ere, 1980). Some species are pathogenic. In terms of the role of protozoa in biological wastewater treatment, the following are of importance: • Consumption of organic matter; • Consumption of free bacteria; • Participation in ﬂoc formation. The last aspect, related to the contribution to the formation of ﬂocs, seems to be a mechanism of lower importance (La Rivi´ere, 1977). The ﬁrst two aspects (consumption of organic matter and of free bacteria) depend on the feeding mode of the protozoa, which varies with its type, as seen below (Horan, 1990): • Flagellates. Use of soluble organic matter by diffusion or active transport. In this feeding mode, bacteria are more efﬁcient in the competition. • Amoebas and ciliates. Formation of a vacuole around the solid particle (that can include bacteria), through a process called phagocytosis. The organic fraction of the particle is then utilised after an enzymatic action inside the vacuole (inside the cell). • Ciliates (principally). Predation of bacteria, algae and other ciliated and ﬂagellated protozoa. Although the protozoa contribute to the removal of the organic matter in sewage, their main role in treatment (by processes such as activated sludge) is by the predatory activity that they exert on bacteria freely suspended in the liquid medium (La Rivi´ere, 1977). Hence, bacteria that are not part of the ﬂoc, but are dispersed in the medium are not normally removed in the ﬁnal sedimentation. As a result, they contribute to the deterioration of the ﬁnal efﬂuent in terms of suspended solids, organic matter (from the bacteria themselves) and even",

Therefore, the action of protozoa on bacteria contributes to improving the quality of the ﬁnal efﬂuent (Horan, 1990). The free-swimming ciliates have greater food requirements than the stalked ciliates, because a large part of their energy is spent in locomotion. The predomi- nance of the stalked ciliates occurs after the decline of the free-swimming ciliates population, when they can feed on the bacteria available in the ﬂoc. 1.7.4 Suspended and attached biomass growth With relation to the structural formation of the biomass, biological sewage treat- ment processes can be divided into the basic conﬁgurations listed below (see Figure 1.6). The list is organised according to the prevailing mechanism, although mechanisms of attached and dispersed growth can occur simultaneously. • Dispersed growth: the biomass grows in a dispersed form in the liquid medium, without any supporting structure Systems: • stabilisation ponds and variants • activated sludge and variants • upﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (receiving wastewaters con- taining suspended solids) • Attached growth: the biomass grows attached to a support medium, form- ing a bioﬁlm. The support medium can be immersed in the liquid medium or receive continuous or intermittent liquid discharges. The support medium can be a solid natural (stones, sand, soil) or artiﬁcial (plastic) material or consist of an agglomerate of the biomass itself (granules). Systems with a solid support for attachment: • trickling ﬁlters • rotating biological contactors",

The greater theoretical development in terms of modelling is with respect to aerobic treatment with dispersed growth. This results from the facts that there have been for many years a larger number of researches directed to the activated sludge process and that the formulation of dispersed-growth models is, in a way, simpler than for attached-growth systems. 1.7.5 The biological ﬂoc in dispersed-growth systems In some treatment processes, such as activated sludge, the organisms concentrate and form a broader structural unit that is called a ﬂoc. Although microorganisms are the agents in BOD removal, the ﬂoc in activated sludge plays an essential role in the organic matter removal process. It is not only the property of the het- erotrophic organisms in stabilising organic matter that makes the activated sludge process efﬁcient. Also of fundamental importance is the property shown by the main microorganisms to organise themselves in the structural unit of a ﬂoc, which is capable of being separated from the liquid by the simple physical mechanism of sedimentation, in separate settling units. This separation allows the ﬁnal ef- ﬂuent to be clariﬁed (with reduced concentrations of suspended organic matter). The quality of the ﬁnal efﬂuent is therefore characterised by low values of soluble BOD (removed in the reactor) and of suspended BOD (ﬂocs removed in the ﬁnal settling unit). The ﬂocculation mechanism, which in water treatment is reached at the expense of adding chemical products, occurs by entirely natural mechanisms in biological sewage treatment. The ﬂoc represents a heterogeneous structure that contains the adsorbed organic matter, inert material from the sewage, microbial material produced, and alive and dead cells. The size of the ﬂoc is regulated by the balance between the forces of cohesion and shear stress caused by the artiﬁcial aeration and agitation (La Rivi´ere, 1977). Among the microorganisms that constitute the ﬂoc, besides the bacteria and protozoa, fungi, rotifers, nematodes and occasionally even insect larvae can be found (Branco, 1978). The ﬂoc matrix can rapidly absorb up to 40% of the soluble and particulate",

Considering that the size of a ﬂoc varies between 50 and 500 µm, there will be a marked gradient of BOD and oxygen concentrations from the external border of the ﬂoc (larger values) to the centre (where very low BOD values and zero DO values can be found). Consequently, in the direction of the centre of the ﬂoc, the bacteria become deprived of nutrient sources, what reduces their viability (Horan, 1990). When analysing the availability of oxygen or nutrients in the liquid medium, their possible absence inside the ﬂoc must be taken into consideration. This supports the fact that, for instance, in many cases anoxic conditions may be assumed, even though a small concentration of DO (0.5 mg/L) in the liquid medium may still be found. Although the liquid medium is not deprived of oxygen, a large part of the ﬂoc is. In this situation, the anoxic conditions are prevalent in the interior of the ﬂoc, and the biochemical reactions take place as if in the absence of oxygen. Figure 1.7 illustrates the BOD and oxygen gradients along the ﬂoc. The conditions that lead to the microbial growth in the form of ﬂocs instead of cells freely suspended in the liquid medium are not fully known. A plausible hypothesis for the structure of the ﬂoc is that the ﬁlamentous bacteria exert the function of a structural matrix, to which the ﬂoc-forming bacteria adhere. It is be- lieved that the attachment occurs through exopolysaccharides, present in the form of a capsule or gelatinous layer. In the past this phenomena was attributed only to Zoogloea ramigera, but there are indications that the production of the gelati- nous layer occurs through various genera, including Pseudomonas. The continuous production of these exopolymers results in the adherence of other microorganisms and colloidal particles and, as a consequence, the ﬂoc size increases.

Figure 1.8 shows an schematics of a typical structure of an activated sludge ﬂoc. The balance between the ﬁlamentous and ﬂoc-forming organisms is delicate, and a good part of the operational success of an activated sludge plant depends on it (see also Chapter 39). Three basic conditions can occur (Horan, 1990): • Equilibrium between ﬁlamentous and ﬂoc-forming organisms. Good set- tleability and thickening properties of the sludge. • Predominance of ﬂoc-forming organisms. There is insufﬁcient rigidity in the ﬂoc, generating a small and weak ﬂoc, with poor settleability. This results in the so-called pin-point ﬂoc. • Predominance of ﬁlamentous organisms. The ﬁlaments extend themselves outside the ﬂoc, impeding the adherence of other ﬂocs. Therefore, after sedimentation, the ﬂocs occupy an excessively large volume, which can bring problems in the operation of the secondary sedimentation tank, caus- ing a deterioration in the quality of the ﬁnal efﬂuent. Such a condition is called sludge bulking. 1.7.6 Bioﬁlm in attached growth systems Immobilisation is the attachment of the microorganisms to a solid or suspended supporting medium.

Although practically all the microorganisms have the potential to adhere to a supporting medium through the production of extracellular polymers that allow physical– chemical attachment,it is only recently that the technological application of cellular sorption processes is being employed in a wider and optimised scale in various biotechnological processes and in sewage treatment (Lubberding, 1995). The attachment is inﬂuenced by cell-to-cell interactions, by the presence of polymer molecules on the surface and by the composition of the medium (Rouxhet and Mozes, 1990). In the bioﬁlm, the compounds necessary for bacterial development, such as organic matter, oxygen and micronutrients, are adsorbed onto the surface. After adhering, they are transported through the bioﬁlm through diffusion mechanisms, where they are metabolised by the microorganisms. Colloidal or suspended solids cannot diffuse through the bioﬁlm and need to be hydrolysed to smaller molecules. The ﬁnal metabolic products are transported in the opposite direction, to the liquid phase (Iwai and Kitao, 1994). Figure 1.9 illustrates the operating principle of a bioﬁlm in sewage treatment. In an aerobic reactor, oxygen is consumed as it penetrates the bioﬁlm, until anoxic or anaerobic conditions are reached. Therefore, an external layer with oxy- gen and an internal layer deprived of oxygen may be found. DO is the determining factor in the establishment of the layers. Nitrate reduction will occur in the anoxic layer. In anaerobic conditions, there will be the formation of organic acids and a reduction of sulphates. This coexistence between aerobic, anoxic and anaero- bic conditions is an important characteristic of bioﬁlm systems (Iwai and Kitao, 1994). The bioﬁlm formation process can be understood as occurring at three stages (Iwai and Kitao, 1994).

In dispersed growth systems, in order to have microbial population growth, the hydraulic detention time(average time that a water molecule stays in the system) has to be greater than the doubling time of the microorganisms, that is, the time necessary to generate new cells. If the hydraulic detention time is less than the cell doubling time, the bacteria are “washed” out of the system. This is a limiting factor for sizing the biological reactors, considering that reactor volume and detention time are directly related (detention time = volume/ﬂow). In the case of systems with bioﬁlms, the hydraulic detention times can be less than the cell doubling time, without cell wash-out occurring, because of the fact that the bacteria are attached to a support medium. Consequently, it is possible to adopt lower volumes for the reactor. In the comparison between dispersed-growth and attached-growth systems, there are the following aspects relative to attached-growth systems (Iwai and Kitao, 1994; Lubberding, 1995): • The reactor can be operated with a hydraulic detention time lower than the cell doubling time. • The concentration of active biomass can be higher than for dispersed- growth systems (see explanation below). • The substrate removal rate can be higher than for dispersed-growth systems (see explanation below). • The coexistence between aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms is greater than in the dispersed-growth systems because the thickness of the bioﬁlm is usually greater than the diameter of the biological ﬂoc. • The cells are ﬁxed in the solid phase, while the substrate is in the liq- uid phase. This separation reduces the need or the requirements for the subsequent clariﬁcation stage. • The microorganisms are continually reused. In the dispersed-growth sys- tem, reutilisation can only be implemented through recirculation of the biomass. • If the bioﬁlm thickness is high, there can be limitations for the diffusion of the substrate into the bioﬁlm. The potential difference between the activity of the dispersed and attached biomass and the consequent substrate removal rate can be explained as follows (Lubberding, 1995). The dispersed biomass has a density close to the sewage and moves itself in practically the same direction and velocity of the sewage inside the reactor. As a result, the biomass stays exposed to the same fraction of liquid for a larger period, leading to a low substrate concentration in the neighbourhood of the cell. With the low substrate concentrations, the bacterial activity and the substrate removal rate are also lower. Only at a certain distance from the",

This volume is commonly called a reactor. The modiﬁcations in the composition and concentration of the constituents during the residence time of the wastewater in the reactor are essential items in sewage treatment. These changes are caused by: • hydraulic transportation of the materials in the reactor (input and output); • reactions that occur in the reactor (production and consumption). The knowledge of the two components, which characterise the so-called mass balance around the reactor, is fundamental in the design and operation of wastew- ater treatment plants. Finally, the manner and efﬁciency in which these changes take place depend on the type and conﬁguration of the reactor, which is dealt with in the study called reactor hydraulics.

The reaction rate r is the term used to represent the disappearance or formation of a constituent or chemical species. The relation between the reaction rate, concentration of the reagent and the order of reaction is given by the expression: r = kCn (2.1) where: r = reaction rate (ML−3T−1) k = reaction constant (T−1) C = reagent concentration (ML−3) n = reaction order For different values of n, there are the following types of reactions: • n = 0 zero-order reaction • n = 1 ﬁrst-order reaction • n = 2 second-order reaction When there is more than one reagent involved, the calculation of the reaction rate must take into consideration their concentrations. If there are two chemicals with concentrations A and B, the rate is: r = kAn Bm (2.2) The global reaction rate is deﬁned as (m + n). For example, if a global reaction rate was determined as being r = kA2B, the reaction is considered second order with relation to reagent A and ﬁrst order with relation to reagent B. The global reaction rate is of third order (Tchobanoglous and Schroeder, 1985). If the logarithm is applied on both sides of Equation 2.1 for a reaction with only one reagent, the following equation is obtained: log r = log k + n log C (2.3) The visualisation of the above relation for different values of n is presented in Figure 2.1. The interpretation of Figure 2.1 is: • The zero-order reaction results in a horizontal line. The reaction rate is in- dependent of the reagent concentration, that is, it is the same independently of the reagent concentration. • The ﬁrst-order reaction has a reaction rate directly proportional to the reagent concentration.",

The most frequent reaction orders found in sewage treatment are zero order and ﬁrst order. Second order reactions may occur with some speciﬁc industrial wastewaters. The reaction order does not necessarily need to be an integer, and the laboratory determination of the decomposition rates of certain industrial con- stituents can lead to intermediate orders. Besides these reactions with constant order, there is another type of reaction, which is widely used in the area of wastew- ater treatment, called saturation reaction. In summary, the following reactions are going to be analysed in detail: • zero-order reaction • ﬁrst-order reaction • saturation reaction. 2.2.2 Zero-order reactions Zero-order reactions are those in which the reaction rate is independent of the reagent concentration. In these conditions, the rate of change of the reagent con- centration (C) is constant. This comment assumes that the reaction occurs in a batch reactor (see Item 2.4), in which there is no addition or withdrawal of the reagent during the reaction. In the case of a reagent that is disappearing in the reactor (for example, through decomposition mechanisms), the rate of change is given by Equation 2.4.

The introduc- tion of oxygen by artiﬁcial aeration is an example. Other examples are the removal of organic matter in some systems and the decay of pathogenic organisms. The bio- logical stabilisation of the organic matter may be represented by pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction, as covered in Section 2.2.4. Although various components are involved, such as oxygen concentration, number of microorganisms and concentration of the organic matter, the rate can be proportional to the concentration of one con- stituent (organic matter, in this case), provided the others are in relative abundance (Arceivala, 1981). However, if the organic matter is available in low concentra- tions, the reaction occurs as a ﬁrst-order reaction. This aspect is discussed in Section 2.2.4. The global rate follows ﬁrst-order kinetics in various complex processes. Many substances can individually show zero-order kinetics, but the complex substrates in which many of these substances are aggregated (e.g. domestic and industrial wastewater) can suffer a decay rate that follows a ﬁrst-order reaction. Initially, when most of the components are being simultaneously removed (consumed), the global removal rate is high. After a certain time, however, the rate can be slower,",

Initially, when most of the components are being simultaneously removed (consumed), the global removal rate is high. After a certain time, however, the rate can be slower, when only the most hardly degradable constituents are still present. In this case, the global reaction rate may resemble a typical ﬁrst-order reaction (Arceivala, 1981). 2.2.4 Saturation reactions Another expression used to describe the rates involved in biological sewage treat- ment is based on enzymatic reactions, whose kinetics were proposed by Michaelis and Menten. Since bacterial decomposition involves a series of reactions catalysed by enzymes, the structure of the Michaelis–Menten expression can be used to de- scribe the kinetics of bacterial growth and the decomposition reactions in sewage (Sawyer and McCarty, 1978) (see Chapter 3). The reaction rate follows a hyperbolic form, in which the rate tends to a satu- ration value (Equation 2.11): r = rmax. S Ks + S (2.11) where r = reaction rate (ML−3T−1) rmax = maximum reaction rate (ML−3T−1) S = concentration of the limiting substrate (ML−3) Ks = half-saturation constant (ML−3) Through Equation 2.11, it is seen that Ks is the concentration of the substrate in which the reaction rate r is equal to rmax/2. Equation 2.11 is illustrated in Figure 2.4. Equation 2.11 is widely used in biological sewage treatment. Its large impor- tance resides in its form that can approximately represent zero-order and ﬁrst-order Figure 2.4. Graphical representation of the saturation reaction, according to Michaelis–Menten",

Graphical representation of the saturation reaction, according to Michaelis–Menten kinetics (see Figure 2.5), as well as the transition between them. As mentioned be- fore, at the start of a reaction of decomposition of substrate (organic matter), when the concentration is still high, there is no substrate limitation in the medium and the global removal rate approaches zero-order kinetic. When the substrate starts to be consumed, the reaction rate starts to decrease, characterising a transition region or mixed order. When the substrate concentration is very low, the reaction rate starts to be limited by the low availability of organic matter in the medium. In these conditions, the kinetics develops as in a ﬁrst-order reaction. These situations occur as a function of the relative values of S and Ks, as described below. • Relative substrate concentration: high S >> Ks : approximately zero-order reaction When the substrate concentration is much higher than the value of Ks, Ks can be neglected in the denominator of Equation 2.11. The equation is thus reduced to: r = rmax (2.12) In these conditions, the reaction rate r is constant and equal to the maximum rate rmax. The reaction follows zero-order kinetics, in which the reaction rate is independent of the substrate concentration. In domestic sewage treatment, such a situation tends to occur, for instance, at the head of a plug-ﬂow reactor, where the substrate concentration is still high. • Relative substrate concentration: low S << Ks : approximately low-order reaction When the substrate concentration is much lower than the value of Ks, S can be ignored in the denominator of Equation 2.11. Consequently, the equation is reduced to: r = rmax. S KS (2.13) Sincermax andKs aretwoconstants,theterm(rmax/Ks)isalsoaconstant,and can be substituted by a new constant K. Thus, Equation 2.13 is reduced to: r = K.S (2.14) In this situation, the reaction rate is proportional to the substrate concentra- tion. The reaction follows ﬁrst-order kinetics.

Figure 2.5 presents the two extreme situations, representatives of zero and ﬁrst order-kinetics. The form of the Michaelis–Menten equations is reanalysed in detail in Chap- ter 3 that treats the kinetics of bacterial growth and substrate removal. In these conditions, one has the so-called Monod kinetics. In Chapter 3, typical values of Ks for the treatment of domestic sewage are presented, and the conditions that lead to the predominance of the zero or ﬁrst-order kinetics are re-evaluated. 2.2.5 Inﬂuence of the temperature The rate of any chemical reaction increases with temperature, provided that this increase in temperature does not produce alterations in the reagents or in the cata- lyst. The biological reactions, within certain ranges, also present the same tendency to increase with temperature. However, there is an ideal temperature for the bio- logical reactions, above which the rate decreases, possibly due to the destruction of enzymes at the higher temperatures (Sawyer and McCarty, 1978; Beneﬁeld and Randall, 1980). A usual form to estimate the variation of the reaction rate as a function of temperature is through the formulation based on the van’t Hoff-Arrhenius theory, which can be expressed as: KT2 / KT1 = θT2−T1 (2.15)",

The values of θ usually adopted for the corrections of various reactions involved in sewage treatment are presented in the relevant chapters of this book. 2.3 MASS BALANCE 2.3.1 Representative equations Once the reaction rates of interest are known, their inﬂuence on the general mass balance of the constituent under analysis must be quantitatively evaluated. This is because the concentration of a certain constituent in a reactor (or in any place inside it) is a function, not only of the biochemical reactions, but also of the transport mechanisms (input and output) of the constituent. Reactor is the name given to tanks or generic volumes in which the chemical or biological reactions occur. The mass balance is a quantitative description of all the materials that enter, leave and accumulate in a system with deﬁned physical boundaries. The mass balance is based on the law of conservation of mass, that is, mass is neither created nor destroyed. The basic mass balance expression should be derived in a chosen volume, which can be either a tank or a reactor as a whole, or any volume element of them. In the mass balance, there are terms for (Tchobanoglous and Schroeder, 1985): • materials that enter • materials that leave • materials that are generated • materials that are consumed • materials that are accumulated in the selected volume In any selected volume (see Figure 2.6), the quantity of accumulated material must be equal to the quantity of material that enters, minus the quantity that leaves, plus the quantity that is generated, minus the quantity that is consumed. In linguistic terms, the mass balance can be expressed in the following general form. Accumulation = Input −Output + Production −Consumption (2.16) Some authors prefer not to include in an explicit form the term relative to consumption, which must be expressed as a produced material, with a minus sign in the reaction rate. The convention adopted in this text is the one of Equation 2.16, which leads to a clearer understanding of the four main components involved in",

The convention adopted in this text is the one of Equation 2.16, which leads to a clearer understanding of the four main components involved in the mass balance. Therefore, care and coherence must be exercised with the signs of each term when adopting one convention or another. Mathematically the relation of Equation 2.16 can be expressed as: d (C.V) dt = Q.C0 −Q.C + rp.V −rc.V (2.17) where C = concentration of the constituent at a time t (ML−3) Co = inﬂuent concentration of the constituent (ML−3) V = volume of the reactor (completely mixed) or volume element of any reactor (L3) Q = ﬂow (L3T−1) t = time (T) rp = reaction rate of production of the constituent (ML−3T−1) rc = reaction rate of consumption of the constituent consumed (ML−3T−1) Equation 2.17 can be expressed in the following alternative form, in which the left-hand term has been expanded: C.dV dt + V.dC dt = Q.C0 −Q.C + rp.V −rc.V (2.18) The volume in biological reactors can usually be considered as ﬁxed (dV/dt=0), making the ﬁrst term on the left-hand side disappear. This leads to the simpliﬁed and more usual form of the mass balance, presented in Equation 2.19. Since in this equation the only dimension is time, the formulation is of a ordinary differen- tial equation, in which the analytical solution (or numeric computation) is much simpler. However, it must be emphasised that the mass balance in other systems, such as, for instance, the sludge volume in secondary sedimentation tanks in ac- tivated sludge systems, also implies variations in volume (besides concentration variations).In this particular case, there are two dimensions (time and space), which",

The solution of these equations demands a greater mathematical sophistication. However, for completely-mixed biological reactors (ﬁxed volume), the more usual mass balance, expressed in Equation 2.19, is used. V.dC / dt = Q.C0 −Q.C + rp.V −rc.V (2.19) In the preparation of a mass balance, the following steps must be followed (Tchobanoglous and Schroeder, 1985): • Prepare a simpliﬁed schematic or ﬂowsheet of the system or process for which the mass balance will be prepared. • Draw the system boundaries, to deﬁne where the mass balance will be applied. • List all the relevant data that will be used in the preparation of the mass balance in the schematic or ﬂowsheet. • List all the chemical or biological reaction equations that are judged to represent the process. • Select a convenient basis on which the numerical calculations will be done. 2.3.2 Steady state and dynamic state The mathematical model of the system can be structured for two distinct conditions: • Steady state • Dynamic state Thesteadystateistheoneinwhichtherearenoaccumulationsoftheconstituent in the system (or in the volume being analysed). Thus, dC/dt = 0, that is, the concentration of the constituent is constant. In the steady state, the input and output ﬂows and concentrations are constant. There is a perfect equilibrium between the positive and the negative terms in the mass balance, which, when summed, lead to a zero value. In the design of wastewater treatment plants, it is more usual to use the simpliﬁed steady state equations. Under these conditions, in which dC/dt = 0, the mass balance is given by Equation 2.20. 0 = Q.C0 −Q.C + rp.V −rc.V (2.20) The dynamic state is the one in which there are mass accumulations of the con- stituent in the system. Hence, dC/dt ̸= 0. The concentration of the constituent in the system is therefore variable with time and can increase or decrease, depending on the balance between the positive and negative terms.

Usually in a treatment plant, the input ﬂow and/or the input concentration are variable, besides the possibility of having other external stimulus to the system (temperature changes) that cause a transient in the concentration of the constituent. For this reason, dynamic condi- tions are the ones really prevailing in actual sewage treatment plants. The dynamic models are based on the generalised mass balance equation (Equation 2.19). For the operational control of a treatment plant, dynamic models are more adequate, due to the frequent variation of the external and internal conditions of the system. The dy- namic models can be also used for design, principally for evaluating the impact of variable inﬂuent loads on the performance of the plant. The dynamic models have been less used due to the larger complexity involved in the solution of the equa- tions and the greater requirements of values for model coefﬁcients and variables. However, the trend of using more computers and numerical integration routines commercially available has contributed to a greater use of dynamic models. It must be emphasised that the steady state is only a particular case of the dynamic state. Figure 2.7 illustrates the concept of the steady and dynamic states, through the representation of the variation of the concentration of the constituent with time. 2.4 REACTOR HYDRAULICS 2.4.1 Introduction After the reaction rates are known (Section 2.2) and the mass balances have been established (Section 2.3), in order to calculate the concentration of the constituent in the reactor it is necessary to deﬁne the hydraulic model to be attributed to it. The hydraulic model of the reactor is a function of the type of ﬂow and the mixing pattern in the unit. The mixing pattern depends on the physical geometry of the reactor, the quantity of energy introduced per unit volume, the size or scale of the unit and other factors. In terms of ﬂow, there are the following two conditions: • Intermittent ﬂow (batch): discontinuous input and/or output • Continuous ﬂow: continuous input and output",

In terms of ﬂow, there are the following two conditions: • Intermittent ﬂow (batch): discontinuous input and/or output • Continuous ﬂow: continuous input and output In terms of the mixing pattern, there are two basic idealised hydraulic models, which deﬁne an envelope inside which the other patterns are found. These are the plug-ﬂow and the complete-mix reactors, which lead to the following main alternatives: • plug ﬂow reactor • complete-mix reactor • dispersed ﬂow • reactors in series and/or in parallel. The main types of reactors used in sewage treatment are presented in Table 2.1 (TchobanoglousandSchroeder,1985;Metcalf&Eddy,1991),andtheiroperational characteristics are summarised in Table 2.2. Table 2.1. Characteristics of the most frequently used reactors and hydraulic models in sewage treatment. Batch reactors: A batch reactor is the one in which there is no ﬂow entering or leaving. The reactor contents are completely mixed. All elements are exposed to the treatment for a time equal to the substrate residence time in the reactor. Consequently, the batch reactor behaves like a discrete volume of a plug-ﬂow reactor. The BOD test bottle is an example of a batch reactor. One of the variants of the activated sludge process is the sequencing batch reactors. Plug ﬂow: The ﬂuid particles enter the tank continuously in one extremity, pass through the reactor, and are then discharged at the other end, in the same sequence in which they entered the reactor. The ﬂuid particles move as a piston, without any longitudinal mixing. The particles maintain their identity and stay in the tank for a period equal to the theoretical hydraulic detention time. This type of ﬂow is reproduced in long tanks with a large length-to-breadth ratio, in which longitudinal dispersion is minimal. These reactors are also called tubular reactors. Plug-ﬂow reactors are idealised reactors, since complete absence of longitudinal dispersion is difﬁcult to obtain in practice. (Continued )",

These reactors are also called tubular reactors. Plug-ﬂow reactors are idealised reactors, since complete absence of longitudinal dispersion is difﬁcult to obtain in practice. (Continued ) Complete mix: The particles that enter the tank are immediately dispersed in all the reactor body. The input and output ﬂows are continuous. The ﬂuid particles leave the tank in proportion to their statistical population. Complete mix can be obtained in circular or square tanks in which the tank’s contents are continuously and uniformly distributed. Complete-mix reactors are also known as CSTR or CFSTR (continuous-ﬂow stirred tank reactors). Complete-mix reactors are idealised reactors, since total and identical dispersion is difﬁcult to obtain in practice. Dispersed ﬂow: Dispersed or arbitrary ﬂow is obtained in any reactor with an intermediate degree of mixing between the two idealised extremes of plug ﬂow and complete mix. In reality, most reactors present dispersed-ﬂow conditions. However, due to the greater difﬁculty in their modelling, the ﬂow pattern is frequently represented by one of the two idealised hydraulic models. The input and output ﬂows are continuous. Complete-mix reactors in series: Complete-mix reactors in series are used to model the hydraulic regime that exists between the idealised plug ﬂow and complete mix regimes. If the series is composed of only one reactor, the system reproduces a complete-mix reactor. If the system has an inﬁnite number of reactors in series, plug ﬂow is reproduced. Input and output ﬂows are continuous. Reactors in series are also commonly found in maturation ponds. Packed-bed reactors: These reactors are ﬁlled with some type of packing medium, such as stone, plastic, ceramic and others. Regarding the ﬂow and saturation, these reactors can be submerged, with the pores saturated (anaerobic ﬁlters and submerged aerated ﬁlters) or with intermittent dosing, with non-saturated pores (trickling ﬁlters).

The table outlines operational characteristics of three main reactor systems under steady-state conditions: batch reactor, plug flow reactor, and complete mix reactor. A batch reactor has no continuous flow, exhibits variation in composition over time at a given position, but no spatial variation at a given time, with no equivalent complete mix reactors and a typical length-to-breadth ratio of approximately 1. A plug flow reactor supports continuous flow, has no temporal variation at a position, but shows variation in composition along the reactor’s length at a given time, is equivalent to an infinite number of complete mix reactors, and has a length-to-breadth ratio much greater than 1. A complete mix reactor also operates with continuous flow, lacks variation in composition either over time or along the reactor, is equivalent to one complete mix reactor, and has a typical length-to-breadth ratio of approximately 1. 2.4.2 Ideal plug-ﬂow reactor The ideal plug ﬂow is the one in which each ﬂuid element leaves the tank in the same order of entrance. No element anticipates or delays another in the journey. The ﬂow occurs as pistons moving from upstream to downstream, without mixing between the pistons and without dispersion. Consequently, each element is exposed to treatment for the same period of time (as in a batch reactor), which is equal to the theoretical hydraulic detention time (Arceivala, 1981). Figure 2.8 presents a summary of the concentration proﬁles with time and posi- tion in an ideal plug-ﬂow reactor submitted to constant inﬂuent ﬂow and concentra- tion (steady-state conditions). If the inﬂuent load is varied (dynamic conditions), the derivation of the formulas for the plug-ﬂow reactor is more complicated than for complete mix. This is because the concentration in the plug ﬂow varies with time and space in the reactor, while in complete mix the variation is only with time (same concentration in any position of the reactor). That is why complete-mix re- actors in series are frequently used to simulate a plug-ﬂow reactor under dynamic (time-varying) conditions. If the inﬂuent (input) concentration is constant, the efﬂuent concentration (out- put) also remains constant with time. The concentration proﬁle in the tank and, therefore, the efﬂuent concentration, depend on the type and reaction rate of the constituent. Table 2.3 summarises the main intervening equations. The following generalisations can be made for an ideal plug-ﬂow reactor under steady state conditions: • Conservative substances: the efﬂuent concentration is equal to the inﬂuent concentration. • Biodegradable substances with zero-order reaction: the removal rate is constant from the inlet to the outlet end of the reactor. • Biodegradable substances with ﬁrst-order reaction: along the reactor, the substrate removal coefﬁcient (K) is constant, but the concentration de- creases gradually while the wastewater ﬂows along the reactor.

The mass balance in the reactor is (see Equations 2.16 and 2.19): Accumulation = Input −Output + Production −Consumption (2.21) V.dC / dt = Q.C0 −Q.C + rp.V −rc.V (2.22 In the steady state there is no mass accumulation in the reactor, that is, dC/dt = 0. In this analysis there is no production of constituents, only consumption reactions. Therefore, rp = 0. Dividing the remaining terms by Q, and knowing that t = V/Q, the following equation is obtained: 0 = C0 −C −rc.t (2.23) With the rearrangement of Equation 2.23, concentration proﬁles along the complete-mix reactor and the efﬂuent concentration under steady-state conditions can be calculated (Figure 2.9). If the inﬂuent (input) concentration is constant, the efﬂuent (output) concen- tration also remains constant with time. The efﬂuent concentration depends on the type and reaction rate of the constituent. However, the concentration proﬁle along the reactor depicts a constant concentration, which is in agreement with the assumption that in a complete-mix reactor the concentrations are the same at any point in the tank. Table 2.4 summarises the main equations. In comparison with the plug-ﬂow reactor, the efﬂuent concentration is only dif- ferent for reactions of ﬁrst order (or higher). For such reaction orders, the complete- mix reactor is less efﬁcient than the plug-ﬂow reactor. The following generalisations can be made for an ideal complete-mix reactor under steady-state conditions: • Conservative and biodegradable substances: the concentration and the re- moval rate are the same at any point in the reactor. The efﬂuent concentra- tion is equal to the concentration at any point in the reactor. • Conservative substances: the efﬂuent concentration is equal to the inﬂuent concentration. • Biodegradable substances with zero-order reaction: the efﬂuent concentra- tion is equal to the efﬂuent concentrations of a plug-ﬂow reactor with the same detention time (the removal rate is independent of the local substrate concentration).",

This system can occur in practice, such as in maturation ponds or activated sludge reactors with internal divisions, or it can be used as a theoretical model to represent intermediate hydraulic conditions between the complete-mix and the plug-ﬂow reactor. When the total volume is distributed in only one cell, the system behaves like a conventional complete-mix reactor. Conversely, when the total volume is distributed in an inﬁnite number of cells, the system reproduces plug ﬂow. An intermediate number of cells simulates dispersed ﬂow, with the system approaching the behaviour of complete mix or plug ﬂow depending on the number of subdivisions adopted. When few cells are considered, the system tends to complete mix. On the other hand, when the system is subdivided into a larger number of cells it tends to plug ﬂow.

However, these two ideal models conﬁgure an envelope, inside which the reactors can be found in practice. The reasons that cause real reactors not to follow the ideal models can be (Tchobanoglous & Schroeder, 1985): • Dispersion. The dispersion is the longitudinal transportation of the material due to turbulence and molecular diffusion. • Hydraulic short circuits. These take account of part of the ﬂow and are the result of stratiﬁcation, for instance due to a density difference, and not due to a physical characteristic of the system. The main effect is the reduction in the effective residence time. • Dead volumes. The effect is similar to the short circuits (reduction of the effective residence time), but the causes are a function of the physical characteristics of the system. They occur in corners of tanks, underneath weirs and in the internal side of curves. Consequently, the dispersed or arbitrary ﬂow is a non-idealised case, and can be used in practice to describe ﬂow conditions in most reactors. An approximation of the dispersed ﬂow is represented by the system of cells in series, described in Item 2.4.4. The mixing conditions in dispersed-ﬂow reactors are characterised by a Dispersion number, deﬁned as: d = D/U.L (2.28) where: d = dispersion number (–) D = axial or longitudinal dispersion coefﬁcient (L2T−1) U = mean horizontal velocity (LT−1) L = reactor length (L)",

    "text_to_embed": "The table shows typical values of the dimensionless parameter  d = D/U.L for various treatment units. For rectangular sedimentation tanks, the value ranges from 0.2 to 2.0. In aeration tanks for activated sludge, plug-flow type has a range of 0.1–1.0, while complete mix type and oxidation ditches both have a range of 3.0–4.0 or more. Aerated lagoons have different values depending on shape: long, rectangular ones range from 0.2–1.0, and square format ones range from 3.0–4.0 or more. For non-aerated stabilisation ponds, long, rectangular types have values ranging from 0.1–0.3, while square format ones range from 0.8–1.2. The source of this data is Arceivala (1981). In the two idealised reactors, there are the following limit conditions: • Plug ﬂow: no dispersion (D = 0 and d = 0) • Complete mixing: inﬁnite dispersion (D = ∞and d = ∞) The reactors found in practice have values of d situated between 0 and ∞. The value of d can be estimated by the use of tracers, a topic that is outside the scope of this text. The references (Grady & Lim, 1980; Arceivala, 1981; von Sperling, 1983b; Tchobanoglous & Schroeder, 1985; Viessman & Hammer, 1985) present the methodology and examples for this application. Table 2.6 presents ranges of d values for various treatment units. Treatment units that have d values around 0.2 or less are closer to plug ﬂow. Conversely, units with values of d around 3.0 or more can be considered to approach complete mix. Among the factors that can affect the dispersion of the treatment units, the following can be listed (Arceivala, 1981): • Scale of the mixing phenomenon; • Geometry of the unit; • Energy introduced per unit volume (mechanical or pneumatic); • Type and arrangement of the inlets and outlets; • Inﬂow velocity and its ﬂuctuations; • Density and temperature differences between inﬂow and reactor contents • Reynolds number (which is a function of some of the factors listed above). It is important to note that the characterisation between plug-ﬂow and complete- mix conditions is also a function of the dynamics of the constituent being analysed.

For example, oxidation ditches behave like complete-mix reactors for most of the variables, such as suspended solids and BOD. Samples collected along its length will give approximately the same concentrations. However, for constituents that exhibit fast dynamics, the situation is different. Dissolved oxygen (DO) in activated sludge reactors presents very rapid dynamics, with fast increases or decreases in its concentration. For this reason, DO concentrations are high in the vicinity of the aerators, decreasing due to the bacterial consumption as the liquid ﬂows along the ditch, until it reaches the next aerator. Therefore, there is a gradient of the longitudinal DO concentration along the tank, what characterises a regime approaching plug ﬂow. The analytical solution of the equation for dispersed ﬂow with ﬁrst-order ki- netics was proposed by Wehner and Wilhem in 1956. For other reactions different from ﬁrst order, numerical solutions are necessary. The equation for ﬁrst-order reactions is: C = C0. 4ae1/2d (1 + a)2 ea/2d −(1 −a)2 e−a/2d a = √ 1 + 4K.t.d (2.29) where: d = dispersion number = D/UL = D.t/L2 (–) D = coefﬁcient of longitudinal dispersion (m2/d) U = average ﬂow velocity in the reactor (m/d) L = travel distance (m) th = hydraulic detention time (= V/Q) (d) K = removal coefﬁcient (d−1) C = efﬂuent concentration (g/m3) Co = inﬂuent concentration (g/m3) The advantage of this equation is that it allows a continuous solution between the limits of plug ﬂow and complete mix. When d is small, Equation 2.29 gives results very close to the speciﬁc equation for plug ﬂow. On the other hand, when d is very high, Equation 2.29 produces similar values to those obtained from the equation for complete mix. The use of the Wehner–Wilhem equation can be facilitated through the employ- ment of graphs. Figure 2.12 presents a graph of the dimensionless product K.th versus the removal efﬁciency [(Co −C)/Co], following ﬁrst-order kinetics. Vari- ous curves are presented, all situated inside the envelope represented by d varying from 0 (plug ﬂow) to ∞(complete mix). In the design of a treatment unit, given the values of d and K and for a desired removal efﬁciency, the necessary hydraulic detention time th (and as a result the reactor volume) can be obtained. Similarly, if it is desired to estimate the efﬁciency of a reactor with a pre-deﬁned volume, knowing K, th and d, the efﬁciency can be readily obtained from the graph.

The d values can vary from cell to cell. • If each cell behaves as a complete-mix reactor, the ﬁnal efﬂuent will have the same concentration of that from a reactor with only one cell and a volume equal to the total volume of all cells. Therefore, the subdivision of a reactor (complete mix) into parallel cells (each one complete mix) does not affect the efﬂuent concentration. • However, the point above will not apply for reactors modelled according to dispersed ﬂow, since the subdivision of a reactor into smaller reactors in parallel can lead to reactors with different geometries from the original large reactor. Therefore, the smaller reactors will have different dispersion numbers and, as a result, different efﬂuent concentrations. • For a given total volume, the substrate removal efﬁciency in ﬁrst-order reactions is lower for cells in parallel than for cells in series. However, a parallel arrangement is frequently convenient due to reasons such as operational ﬂexibility, operation continuity even with the closing of one unit, sludge removal etc. 2.4.7 Cells in series with incremental feeding When there is an arrangement of cells in series, it is possible that the inﬂow distribution is split between the various cells. Hence, each cell is fed not only by the efﬂuent from the upstream cell, but also by a fraction of the general inﬂuent. In activated sludge the denomination step feed has been employed to classify plug- ﬂow reactors or cells in series that receive this type of incremental feed. Such an arrangement can also be used in stabilisation ponds and trickling ﬁlters. Figure 2.15 shows possible arrangements of cells in series with step feed. In an arrangement in series with n cells of equal or different volumes with incremental feeding, all the liquid fractions do not receive the same treatment exposure. The ﬁrst fraction receives treatment in all the cells; the second fraction is treated in n −1 cells; the third in n −2 cells and so on.

(n.V1 Q) (2.31) where: n = number of cells in series with incremental feeding (–) V1 = volume of each cell (assuming equal volumes) (m3) Q = total inﬂuent ﬂow in the system (m3/d) It can be seen that such an arrangement has the same efﬁciency of a single complete-mix cell with an equivalent total volume. In other words, a reactor with incremental feeding behaves like a complete-mix reactor. In terms of efﬁciency, the incremental feeding loses the beneﬁts from the arrangement in series. Obviously, other reasons of practical and operational order may justify the inclusion of this option, principally a greater operational ﬂexibility. In the cases when the inlet end of a reactor or the ﬁrst cell are overloaded, such ﬂexibility can contribute to the control of this localised overload. If the cells have different volumes and ﬂows, the calculation can be done in- dividually in each cell through the individual mass balances. If convenient, the dispersed ﬂow model can be adopted for each cell with the corresponding d value. 2.4.8 Cells in series and in parallel With the aim of having greater operational ﬂexibility, the arrangement of cells in series and in parallel is frequently used. Thus, there are the beneﬁts of efﬁciency with the arrangement in series and of ﬂexibility with the arrangement in parallel. Figure 2.16 shows a typical series/parallel arrangement.

Alternatively, the dispersed-ﬂow model can be used with the appropriate value of d for each cell. 2.4.9 The inﬂuence of recirculation In plug-ﬂow or cells-in-series systems, a fraction of the efﬂuent can be recirculated to the inlet of the reactor. Depending on the application, this fractions can be lower, equal or greater than the inﬂuent ﬂow. The recirculation is an inherent component of various treatment processes, such as activated sludge and high rate trickling ﬁlters. In the case of the activated sludge system, the recirculation is speciﬁc, since the recycled liquid has different characteristics (sludge removed from the bottom of the secondary settling tank). Therefore, the characteristics of the return (recycle) sludge are different from the efﬂuent from the reactor, principally in terms of the concentration of the suspended solids. Given the importance of this phenomenon and the complexity of its inter- actions with the reactor, the sludge recirculation in activated sludge systems is not covered in the present section. In any situation, when making a mass balance on the reactor, the following points must be taken into consideration: • The incoming ﬂow to the reactor is equal to the sum of the inﬂuent ﬂow (Qo) and the recycled ﬂow (Qr). • The concentration in the incoming ﬂow to the reactor is given by a weighted average between the inﬂuent and the recycled ﬂows, according to: C′ 0 = Q0.C0 + Qr.Cr Q0 + Qr (2.32) where: C′ o = incoming concentration in the reactor (mixture of the inﬂuent and the recycled ﬂows) (g/m3) Co = concentration in the inﬂuent to the system (g/m3) Cr = concentration of the recycled liquid (g/m3) Qo = inﬂuent ﬂow to the system (m3/d) Qr = recycled ﬂow (m3/d) • The outgoing ﬂow from the reactor is equal to the sum of the inﬂuent ﬂow (Qo) and the recycled ﬂow (Qr). • The concentration in the reactor outlet is obtained using the pertinent equa- tions, as a function of the reaction order and the hydraulic model adopted. In the case of activated sludge, in which the sludge comes from the bottom of the secondary settling tank, the concentrations of the suspended solids in the return sludge are much higher than in the inﬂuent concentration. In these con- ditions, the weighted average leads to an incoming value C′ o greater",

In a generic system, in which the recirculation is taken directly from the efﬂuent from the reactor (with low substrate concentration), the recirculation becomes responsible for a dilution of the inﬂuent substrate concentration. Consequently, the efﬁciency of the system is reduced, in the case of ﬁrst or higher order reactions. 2.4.10 Comparison between the reactor types The comparison between the performances of the various types of reactor is an important topic in the analysis and design of a wastewater treatment plant. As previouslymentioned,thefollowinggeneralisationscanbemade,assumingsteady- state conditions. • Conservative substances: plug-ﬂow reactors, cells in series and complete- mix reactors present the same performance. • Biodegradable substances with a zero-order reaction: plug-ﬂow reactors, cells in series and complete-mix reactors present the same performance. • Biodegradable substances with a ﬁrst-order reaction: the plug-ﬂow reactor presents the highest efﬁciency, followed by the cells-in-series system. The single complete-mix reactor is the least efﬁcient. The statement that a system is more efﬁcient than another implies that, if both present the same efﬂuent concentration, the less efﬁcient system requires a higher detention time. In other words, the less efﬁcient system must have a larger reactor volume. This consideration is of great importance in the design of a treatment plant. Table 2.7 presents a summary of the equations used to calculate the detention time required to obtain a certain concentration Ce in the efﬂuent. The interpretation of Table 2.7 leads to the following points: • Zero-order reactions. For zero-order reactions, the required hydraulic de- tention is the same. • First-order reactions. For ﬁrst-order reactions, the application of the per- tinent formulas leads to the requirement of the greatest detention times for the complete-mix system.",

For ﬁrst-order reactions, the application of the per- tinent formulas leads to the requirement of the greatest detention times for the complete-mix system. • Saturation reactions. For saturation reactions, the result depends on the relative value of Ks with respect to Ce. When Ce >> Ks, the reaction tends to zero order and the reactor volumes for complete mix and plug ﬂow are approximately the same. When Ce << Ks, the reaction tends to ﬁrst order and the complete-mix system requires larger volumes than the plug-ﬂow system. Table2.8presentstherelativevolumesnecessaryforobtainingdifferentremoval efﬁciency values (assuming ideal complete-mix reactors and a ﬁrst-order reaction). The table gives values of the dimensionless product K.th. Based on the desired efﬁciency and on the product K.th (after knowing or estimating K), the required detention time can be obtained. With the detention time and the ﬂow, the volume can be determined (V = th.Q). It is conﬁrmed in this table the fact that, for ﬁrst-order reactions, the plug ﬂow requires the lowest volume for a given efﬁciency. The greater the required efﬁciency, the higher the ratio (complete mix volume) / (plug ﬂow volume). For an efﬁciency of 85% this ratio is 3.0 (= 5.7/1.9), that is, the volume required by a single cell is three times higher than that of the plug ﬂow. However, for an efﬁciency of 99% this ratio becomes 21.5 (= 99/4.6).Thesimplesubdivisionofthe total volume in 2 cells changes these ratios to 1.7 (= 3.2/1.9) and 3.9 (= 18/4.6), respectively.

The analysis undertaken in the present section is based on von Sperling (2002). For a given removal efﬁciency, the estimation of K based on the detention time and on the inﬂuent and efﬂuent concentrations on an existing reactor leads to the two following divergent situations: • adoption of the complete-mix (CSTR) model leads to K values which are greater than those found for dispersed ﬂow • adoption of the plug-ﬂow model leads to K values which are lower than those found for dispersed ﬂow The following example will help to clarify the point. An existing reactor has the following average values of performance indicators: (a) inﬂuent col- iform concentration: C0 = 1 × 107 FC/100 ml; (b) efﬂuent coliform concentra- tion: C = 2.13 × 105 FC/100 ml; (c) detention time: t = 30 days; (d) dispersion number: d = 0.5. Use of Equations 2.33 and 2.34 will lead to the K coefﬁcients for plug ﬂow and complete mix, respectively. An iterative process of trial-and-error will lead to the K coefﬁcient for dispersed ﬂow. The following K values are ob- tained: (a) plug ﬂow: K = 0.13 d−1; (b) CSTR: K = 1.53 d−1; (c) dispersed ﬂow: K = 0.30 d−1. As can be seen, for the same reactor and the same kinetics, different K values are obtained in practice, depending on the hydraulic regime assumed. In principle, there should be only one coefﬁcient, representing the decay of the constituent, according to its kinetics. However, the inadequacy of idealised models in representing in a perfect manner the real hydraulic pattern in the reac- tor leads to the deviations that occur in practice. The reason for the differences observed in the example above is that, since complete-mix reactors are the least efﬁcient for ﬁrst-order removal kinetics, the lower efﬁciency is compensated by a higher K value. Conversely, since plug-ﬂow reactors are the most efﬁcient reac- tors, the K value is reduced",

These divergences have been the subject of considerable confusion in the lit- erature, when expressing K values. Reported K values usually show considerable variations, a large part of which can be attributed to inadequate consideration of the hydraulic regime of the reactor. 2.4.11.2 Relationship between K for idealised regimens (complete mix and plug ﬂow) and K for dispersed ﬂow The present section, also based on von Sperling (2002), describes the relationship between ﬁrst-order K values for the idealised ﬂow patterns (CSTR −KCSTR and plug ﬂow −Kplug), and K for the general ﬂow pattern, dispersed ﬂow (Kdisp). The following explanation demonstrates the methodology applied for the CSTR regime. A similar methodology, using the appropriate equations, was also used for the plug-ﬂow regime. Using the relevant equations for estimating the efﬂuent concentrations under complete mix and dispersed ﬂow, it was calculated, for dif- ferent values of the dimensionless product Kdisp.t and dispersion number d, the corresponding KCSTR, which yields the same efﬁciency of removal (ﬁrst-order ki- netics). The dispersion numbers d ranged from extremely high values (100,000, representing complete-mix conditions) to extremely low values (0.001, represent- ing plug-ﬂow conditions). The results are presented in Table 2.10, showing the ratio between the K for CSTR and K for dispersed ﬂow (KCSTR/Kdisp). The interpretation of the table is as follows. The same reactor analysed in the previous section, with d = 0.5, detention time t = 30 days and Kdisp = 0.3 d−1 has the dimensionless product Kdisp.t = 0.3 × 30 = 9.0. For d = 0.5 and Kdisp.t = 9, the table shows that the KCSTR is equal to 5.144 times Kdisp. In other words, KCSTR is 5.144 × 0.3 = 1.54 d−1. This value is, apart from rounding values, the same obtained in the previous section (1.53 d−1), indicating the applicability of the table. The estimation of the removal efﬁciency using the dispersed-ﬂow model (using Kb for dispersed ﬂow) and the CSTR model (using Kb for CSTR) will lead to the same results. Table 2.11 shows the corresponding values for the plug-ﬂow model. In the same example, it is seen from Table 2.11",

Therefore, Kplug = 0.430 × 0.3 = 0.13 d−1 (which is exactly the same value determined in the previous section). Figure 2.17 illustrates the data from Tables 2.10 and 2.11. It can be clearly seen that, for the CSTR regime, the smaller the dispersion number d, the greater the departure between KCSTR and Kdisp.

In reactors without mechanical mixing, the lowering of the dispersion number d occurs with the increase in the length/breadth (L/B) ratio. In other words, a bafﬂed reactor is likely to have a low value of d. Under these circumstances, utilisation of the CSTR model will be completely inadequate, due to the large difference between KCSTR and Kdispersed, the latter being naturally expected to be a better predictor of the actual behaviour in the reactor.

In order to extend the applicability of Tables 2.10 and 2.11, a regression analysis was done by von Sperling (2002), having as dependent variable the ratio between the K value for the idealised regime (CSTR or plug ﬂow) and the K value for the general regime (dispersed ﬂow). The dependent variables were then KCSTR / Kdisp and Kplug / Kdisp. The independent variables were the dimensionless product Kdisp.t and the dispersion number d. Two regression analyses were done, each one having different applicability ranges.

From the equations, it is seen that KCSTR/Kdisp will always be greater than 1.0, whereas Kplug/Kdisp will always be lower than 1.0. 2.4.12 The inﬂuence of variable loads 2.4.12.1 General concepts The comparison between the efﬁciencies presented in Section 2.4.10 was based on the steady-state assumption, in which the inﬂuent characteristics remain constant. In a wastewater treatment plant this constancy rarely occurs. The variation of the ﬂow and concentration along the day is responsible for the fact that, in reality, the system always operates in a dynamic state. Besides this, various other factors can contribute to a greater variability, such as stormwater ﬂow (especially in combined systems) and industrial discharges. The latter can occur without any established periodical pattern and can be responsible for shock loads at the works. The shock loads can be of various natures, such as hydraulic, organic, toxic, of a non- biodegradable substance, thermal etc. A wastewater treatment plant must be apt to receive overloads that occur routinely or frequently, as well as a major part of the unpredicted overloads. In the situations in which this variability component is substantial, the concep- tion of the system must take this fact into consideration, the importance of which could even surpass the efﬁciency considerations discussed in Section 2.4.10. The effects of shock loads are best evaluated through the study of transients, using dy- namic mathematical models of the system. These simulations can use the typical or",

The effects of shock loads are best evaluated through the study of transients, using dy- namic mathematical models of the system. These simulations can use the typical or expected variations of the inﬂuent characteristics, such as standardised variations. Some of the standardised variations of the inﬂuent characteristics normally used in transient analysis are (see Figure 2.18): The analysis of these elements is outside the scope of this book (with the exception of the step function, covered in Sections 2.4.12.2 and 2.4.12.3). However, some generalisations can be made: • Toxic substances instantaneously added as spikes. The peak in the efﬂuent from the complete-mix reactor is the smallest, opposed to the plug-ﬂow reactor, which presents the highest peak in the efﬂuent. The good perfor- mance of the complete-mix reactor is caused by the large and instantaneous dilution provided at the entrance in the reactor. Additionally, the greater volume required for the single-cell complete-mix reactor contributes to the smoothing of the shock load. In the ﬁrst reactor of a system with cells in series or at the head of a plug-ﬂow reactor the toxic concentrations can be very high, due to the lower volumes involved. • Toxic substances with step increase. The plug-ﬂow reactor subjected to a step load of a conservative substance reaches a new equilibrium concentra- tion after a time equal to 1 th. In the same period, the complete-mix reactor reaches only 63% of the equilibrium concentration, 3 th being required for the concentration in the reactor to reach 95% of the equilibrium concen- tration. This larger time can be fundamental for sustaining the system or for corrective operational control measures to be taken. Also in this case the larger volumes usually found in the complete-mix reactors contribute to a greater stability in the system. • Overload of biodegradable substances.

As already seen, for ﬁrst-order re- actions, the efﬁciency of a single complete-mix reactor is lower than that of a system in series or a plug ﬂow. However, the consideration of the volume of the unit plays an important role in the case of transients. In the ﬁrst cell of a system in series or in the head of a plug-ﬂow reactor, due to the lower volume involved, the effect of the overload can be more deleterious. In aerobic systems, if the oxygenation capacity in these volumes is not sufﬁcient, the organic overload could even lead to anaerobic conditions. • Hydraulic overload. When a sudden increase in the ﬂow occurs, a dilution of the reactor contents also takes place, which can be responsible for the washing-out of biomass from the reactor. With the decrease in biomass concentration, there is a resulting reduction in the efﬁciency of the system. The smaller the reactor volume, the greater is its susceptibility to this wash- out. For this reason, single-cell complete-mix reactors are more stable than systems in series or plug ﬂow. Depending on the way in which the ﬁnal efﬂuent quality is monitored, the concept of efﬁciency can vary: • Composite samples. Systems that verify the ﬁnal efﬂuent quality through composite samples cannot detect the concentration peaks in the efﬂuent. In these cases, the greater stability provided by the complete-mix system may not be apparent • Simple samples. Systems that verify the ﬁnal efﬂuent quality through simple (instantaneous or grab) samples are subject to the collection of a sample at a moment of peak concentration in the efﬂuent. This can be sufﬁcient for a WWTP to be detected as infringing the discharge standards. In this situation, the stability provided by the complete-mix system will be apparent. In summary, the selection between one type of reactor and another is a com- promise between mean efﬁciency and stability. Each case must be analysed indi- vidually. 2.4.12.2 Plug-ﬂow reactor subjected to step variations in the inﬂuent concentration In an ideal plug-ﬂow reactor, in the cases when the inﬂuent concentration increases instantaneously to a new level (at which it stays), the behaviour is very similar to that described for constant concentrations (steady state). The main difference is in the sense that the change takes place while the plug with the new concentration ﬂows downstream.

This is due to the hydraulic characteristics of the complete-mix reactor, in which the inﬂuent substance is immediately dispersed in the tank, instantaneously appearing in the efﬂuent. With the continuous arrival of the new higher inﬂuent concentration, the efﬂuent concen- tration continues to increase until the transient conditions stop and a new level is reached. The efﬂuent concentration remains at this new level, because a new steady state has been reached, until there is a new change in the inﬂuent characteristics. Figure 2.20 shows the behaviour of a complete-mix reactor subjected to a step increase in inﬂuent concentration of conservative constituents and constituents that decay according to 0 and 1st order kinetics. The equations presented for the transients are asymptotic with relation to the new equilibrium value. Thus, in strict mathematical terms, a new equilibrium value will never be reached. For conser- vative substances, the utilisation of the equation C = C0.(1 −e−t/th) leads to the following values of the ratio C/C0 (remaining concentration / inﬂuent concentra- tion). t/th 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 C/C0 0.63 0.86 0.95 0.98 0.99 It can be observed that, after a time corresponding to the hydraulic detention time, the concentration of a conservative substance is 63% of the new equilibrium concentration (which is equal to the new inﬂuent concentration in the case of con- servative substances). After a time equal to three times the hydraulic detention time, the concentration is equal to 95% of the equilibrium concentration. Hence, in practical terms, it can be considered that after a period greater than 3th, a new equilibrium concentration will be reached. In any of the three equations (conser- vative substances, zero and ﬁrst order reactions) presented in Figure 2.20 for the step function, when the time tends to inﬁnity, the equations are converted into the steady-state form (presented in Table 2.4).",

The microbial action starts in the sewerage system and reaches its maximum in the sewage treatment works. In treatment plants, the conversion of organic matter to more oxidised or re- duced forms takes place. Under aerobic conditions there is the oxidation of the organic matter (carbonaceous matter), that is, the organic carbon is converted into its most oxidised form (CO2: carbon in the oxidation state of 4+). Un- der anaerobic conditions, the conversion reaction of the organic matter leads to the most oxidised form of carbon (CO2), but also to its most reduced form (CH4: carbon with an oxidation state of 4−). In sewage treatment un- der aerobic conditions, the conversion of ammonia (nitrogenous matter) into more oxidised forms of nitrogen (NO3 −) can take place, and, under anoxic conditions, the subsequent conversion of these to reduced forms (N2) can also happen. Biological wastewater treatment therefore includes oxidation (in- crease of the oxidation state) and reduction (decrease in the oxidation state) reactions.",

It can be observed that there is a high complexity in the interrelation of the various compounds and biomass. The follow- ing items describe the main concepts and mechanisms related with the interaction of the biomass (central area of the ﬁgure) with the carbonaceous and nitrogenous (side areas) matter. 3.1.2 Characterisation of the carbonaceous matter The carbonaceous matter (based on organic carbon) present in the wastewater to be treated can be divided in terms of biodegradability into (a) inert or (b) biodegradable. • The inert organic matter (non-biodegradable) passes through the treat- ment system without changing its form.

The non-biodegradable particulate organic matter (sus- pended) is involved by the biomass and is removed together with the sludge (excess sludge or the sludge that settles at the bottom of the reactors). • The biodegradable organic matter is changed in its passage through the system. Two fractions can be identiﬁed, related to the biodegradability, which is also dependent on the physical state: • Rapidly biodegradable. This fraction is usually in a soluble form and consists of relatively simple molecules. These molecules can be directly used by the heterotrophic bacteria. • Slowly biodegradable. This fraction is usually in a particulate form, although slowly-biodegradable soluble organic matter may be present. The slowly-biodegradable matter consists of relatively com- plex molecules that are not directly used by the bacteria. For this to oc- cur, the conversion into soluble matter is necessary, through the action of extracellular enzymes. This conversion mechanism, called hydroly- sis, does not involve the use of energy, but results in the delay in the consumption of the organic matter (see Chapter 1). 3.1.3 Characterisation of the nitrogenous matter The ﬁrst major division in the nitrogenous matter that enters a sewage treatment works is by its organic state: the nitrogenous matter may be (a) inorganic or (b) or- ganic. • The inorganic nitrogen is represented by ammonia, either in its free form (NH3) or in its ionised form (NH + 4 ). Ammonia is present in the inﬂuent sewage because the hydrolysis and ammoniﬁcation reactions, described below, have already started in the sewerage system. • The organic nitrogen is divided in a similar form to the carbonaceous matter,asafunctionofthebiodegradability:(a)inertand(b)biodegradable. • Inert. The inert fraction is divided into two fractions, according to the physical state: – Soluble. This part is usually negligible and does not need to be considered. – Particulate. This part is associated with the non-biodegradable car- bonaceous organic matter, being involved by the biomass and re- moved with the excess sludge. • Biodegradable. The biodegradable fraction can be subdivided into the following three components: – Rapidly biodegradable. The rapidly-biodegradable organic ni- trogenous matter is in a soluble form and is converted by heterotrophic bacteria into ammonia, through the process of am- moniﬁcation. – Slowly biodegradable.

This hydroly- sis occurs in parallel with the hydrolysis of the carbonaceous matter. – Ammonia. Ammonia (inorganic nitrogen) results from the hydrol- ysis and ammoniﬁcation processes described above. Ammonia is used by heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria. 3.1.4 Participation of the biomass From the above, it is assumed that (a) the carbonaceous matter used directly by the bacteria is present in a soluble form (rapidly biodegradable), and that (b) the nitrogenous matter used directly by the bacteria will be present in the form of ammonia. The biomass present in biological treatment systems can be divided into the following groups, as a function of its viability: (a) active biomass and (b) inert residue. • The inert residue is formed through the decay of the biomass involved in the sewage treatment. The biomass decay can take place according to vari- ous mechanisms, which include endogenous metabolism, death, predation and others. As a result, slowly-degradable products are generated, as well as particulated products, inert to biological attack. • The active biomass is that responsible for the biological degradation of the compounds. Depending on the carbon source, the biomass can be divided into (a) heterotrophic and (b) autotrophic (see Chapter 1): • Active heterotrophic biomass. The carbon source for the heterotrophic organisms is the carbonaceous organic matter. The heterotrophic biomass uses the rapidly biodegradable carbonaceous matter (solu- ble). Part of the energy associated with these molecules is incorpo- rated into the biomass, while the remainder is used to supply energy for synthesis. In aerobic treatment, the growth of the heterotrophic biomass is possible in aerobic (using oxygen as an electron acceptor – see Chapter 1) or anoxic (absence of oxygen, by using the nitrate as an electron acceptor) conditions, but is very low in anaerobic con- ditions (absence of oxygen or nitrate). The heterotrophic bacteria use nitrogen in the form of ammonia for synthesis (in aerobic and anoxic conditions) and nitrogen in the form of nitrate as an elec- tron acceptor (in anoxic conditions). The decay of the heterotrophic biomass generates, besides the inert residue, slowly degradable car- bonaceous and nitrogenous matter. These subsequently need to undergo the hydrolysis process, to be converted into rapidly-biodegradable mat- ter, which can be used again by the heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass.",

The carbon source for the autotrophic or- ganisms is carbon dioxide. The autotrophic biomass uses ammonia as the energy source (they are chemoautotrophic organisms, that is, they use inorganic matter as energy source). In aerobic conditions, these bacteria use ammonia in the nitriﬁcation process, in which ammonia is converted into nitrite and then nitrate. Similarly to the heterotrophic organisms, the decay of the autotrophic biomass also generates, besides an inert residue, slowly-degradable carbonaceous and nitrogenous mat- ter. These subsequently need to undergo hydrolysis, to be converted to rapidly-biodegradable matter, which can be used again by the het- erotrophic and autotrophic biomass. 3.1.5 Representation of the biomass and the substrate 3.1.5.1 Representation of the biomass Due to the difﬁculty in characterising the biological solids and the substrate ac- cording to the above concepts, most of the mathematical models introduce simpli- ﬁcations in their representation. Such simpliﬁed representations are described in the present section. The unit of mass of the microbial cells is normally expressed in terms of suspended solids (SS), since the biomass consists of solids that are sus- pended in the reactor (in the case of dispersed growth). However, not all the solids mass participates in the conversion of the organic substrate, as there is an inorganic fraction that does not play an active role in biological treatment. Therefore, the biomass is frequently expressed in terms of volatile suspended solids (VSS). These represent the organic fraction of the biomass – the organic matter can be volatised, that is, converted into gas by combustion (oxidation). However, as mentioned, not all the organic fraction of the biomass is re- ally active (Eckenfelder, 1980; Marais and Ekama, 1976; Grady and Lim, 1980; IAWPRC, 1987). Thus, the volatile suspended solids can be divided into an active and an inactive fraction. The active fraction is that which has the real participation in the conversion of the substrate. The main lim- itation of the use of the active solids in the design and operational con- trol of a treatment plant relates to the difﬁculty in their determination. There are indirect processes, based on DNA, ATP, proteins, and others, but none compares to the simplicity of the direct determination of volatile suspended solids. Besides considering the biomass activity, the solids can also be inter- preted with relation to their biodegradability. Not all the volatile suspended",

In terms of carbonaceous matter, the present text adopts BOD5 or COD as variables representing the substrate. In order to make the text more applicable, the treatment processes that have been traditionally designed using BOD5 maintain it as the basic variable. On the other hand, the more recent processes that have been using COD for design are also described in terms of COD. As a result, the following variables are adopted in terms of the representation of the substrate (carbonaceous matter): • Inﬂuent substrate So (inﬂuent BOD5 or COD). Represents the total BOD5 (soluble BOD + particulate BOD) or total COD (soluble COD + partic- ulate COD) inﬂuent to the biological reactor. Even in systems with primary sedimentation, around 1/3 of the suspended solids are not removed in this stage and enter the biological reactor. In the reactor, suspended solids are adsorbed by the biomass and are converted into soluble solids by hydrolysis mechanisms, after which they undergo the conversion reactions. Therefore, in the inﬂuent to the reactor, the soluble substrate as well as the particulate substrate must be computed as the inﬂuent substrate to be removed. • EfﬂuentsubstrateS(efﬂuentBOD5orCOD).Representstheefﬂuentsoluble BOD5 or soluble COD from the reactor.

Even though the efﬂuent from the reactor could contain a high concen- tration of suspended solids (biological solids that compose the biomass), these solids are largely removed in the subsequent settling stage, when existent (e.g. secondary sedimentation tank or sedimentation lagoons). In the design of a reactor that receives recycled solids, there is no point in computing the efﬂuent total BOD or COD from it, because it can be occa- sionally larger than the inﬂuent BOD or COD, due to the high concentration of particulate organic matter represented by the microbial population. The quality of the ﬁnal efﬂuent from the treatment plant depends on the (a) soluble BOD or COD: reactor performance; (b) particulate BOD or COD: performance of the ﬁnal settling unit (when existent) or the concentration of the efﬂuent solids from the reactor (when there is no ﬁnal settling unit). 3.2 CONVERSION PROCESSES OF THE CARBONACEOUS AND NITROGENOUS MATTERS 3.2.1 Conversion of the carbonaceous matter 3.2.1.1 Aerobic conversion The general equation of aerobic respiration can be expressed as: C6H12O6 organic matter + 6 O2 −→6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Energy (3.1) This equation is general and simpliﬁed, since, in reality, there are various in- termediate steps. The composition of the organic matter is simpliﬁed and, in this case, the molecular formula of the glucose is assumed as a representation of the carbonaceous organic matter. By analysing the reaction, the following aspects can be highlighted, all important in sewage treatment (Branco, 1976): • Stabilisation of the organic matter (conversion to inert products, such as carbon dioxide and water). • Utilisation of oxygen. • Production of carbon dioxide. • Release of energy. Equation 3.1 can be expressed in a generic way by an organic compound with molecular formula CxHyOz, which permits the calculation of the oxygen consump- tion and the production of carbon dioxide (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994): CxHyOz + 1 4(4x + y −2z) O2 →x CO2 + y 2H2O (3.2) As mentioned, Equations 3.1 and 3.2 are generic, covering only the oxidation of the carbonaceous organic matter. Other elements (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.) are frequently part of the composition of the organic matter, which is still able to undergo biochemical oxidation.",

The main agents responsible for the aerobic stabilisation of the carbonaceous matter contained in the sewage are the decomposing organisms, which are mainly represented by aerobic and facultative heterotrophic bacteria. 3.2.1.2 Anaerobic conversion The conversion of the carbonaceous matter under anaerobic conditions follows the equation below: C6H12O6 organic matter −→3 CH4 + 3 CO2 + Energy (3.3) This equation is also general and simpliﬁed, and represents only the ﬁnal product from the intermediate stages. The following aspects can be highlighted in the equation: • Non-exclusivity of the oxidation. The carbon of CO2 is present in its highest state of oxidation (+4). However, the opposite occurs with CH4, in which the carbon is in its most reduced state (−4), subsequently being able to be oxidised (for example, by combustion – methane is inﬂammable). • No utilisation of oxygen. • Production of methane and carbon dioxide. • Release of energy (less than in aerobic respiration). The organic matter was only converted to a more oxidised form (CO2) and another more reduced form (CH4). However, most of the CH4 is released to the gaseous phase, which then leads to an effective removal of the organic matter. Equation 3.3 can be expressed in a generic way for an organic compound CxHyOz as (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994): CxHyOz + 4x −y −2z 4 H2O →4x −y + 2z 8 CO2 + 4x + y −2z 8 CH4 (3.4) The anaerobic conversion occurs in two stages: • Acidogenic phase: conversion of the organic matter into organic acids by acidogenic organisms (acid-forming organisms). In this stage, there is only the conversion of organic matter, but no removal. • Methanogenic phase: conversion of the organic acids into methane, carbon dioxide and water by methanogenic organisms (methane-forming organ- isms).The organic matter is converted again,but because CH4 is transferred to the atmosphere, there is the removal of the organic matter. Before the acidogenesis stage, the complex organic compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) need to be converted into simple organic compounds, through the mechanism of hydrolysis.",

In the end of the treatment, the quantity of organic nitrogen is small. An important oxidation reaction that occurs in some wastewater treatment pro- cesses is the nitriﬁcation, in which the ammonia is transformed into nitrites and these nitrites into nitrates.

The transformation of ammonia into nitrites is done by bacteria, such as those from the genus Nitrosomonas, according to the following reaction: 2NH4+ + 3O2 Nitrosomonas −→2NO2 −+ 4H+ + 2H2O (3.5) The oxidation of the nitrites to nitrates occurs mainly by the action of bacteria, such as those from the genus Nitrobacter, according to: 2 NO2−+ O2 Nitrobacter −→2 NO3− (3.6) The global reaction of nitriﬁcation is the sum of Equations 3.5 and 3.6: NH4+ + 2 O2 −→NO3−+ 2 H+ + H2O (3.7) In the reactions 3.5 and 3.6 (as well as in the global reaction 3.7), the following points should be noted: • Consumption of free oxygen. This consumption is called nitrogenous de- mand. • Release of H+, consuming the alkalinity of the medium and possibly re- ducing the pH. Figure 3.3 shows a typical distribution of the nitrogen compounds in a treatment system after ammoniﬁcation and the subsequent nitriﬁcation. The oxidised forms of nitrogen (nitrites and nitrates) are collectively called NOx. It is seen that with nitriﬁcation there is no removal of nitrogen (total nitrogen remains the same), but only conversion of the nitrogen forms. 3.2.2.2 Reduction of nitrate (denitriﬁcation) Inanoxicconditions(absenceofoxygen,butinthepresenceofnitrates),thenitrates are used by heterotrophic organisms as an electron acceptor instead of oxygen. In this process, called denitriﬁcation, nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas, according to the following reaction: 2 NO3−+ 2 H+ −→N2 + 2.5 O2 + H2O (3.8)",

It is seen that, besides the conversion in the forms of nitrogen, there is also the removal of nitrogen (total nitrogen is decreased). In other words, denitriﬁcation leads to an effective removal of nitrogen from the liquid, corresponding to the nitrate that is converted to nitrogen gas, which escapes to the atmosphere. 3.3 TIME PROGRESS OF THE BIOCHEMICAL OXIDATION OF THE CARBONACEOUS MATTER In a simpliﬁed manner and neglecting intermediate mechanisms, it can be said that the aerobic reactions for the stabilisation of the organic matter occur, in a closed system (such as the bottle used in the BOD test), in a sequence in which the two following main mechanisms are predominant (Eckenfelder, 1980): • Initial stage: predominance of synthesis (anabolism) At the beginning, the organic matter present in the wastewater is used by the microorganisms for their metabolic activities of growth and energy",

This phase results in oxygen consumption and in the increase in the microorgan- isms population, and can be represented by the generic equation (Hanisch, 1980): 8 CH2O + NH3 + 3 O2 −→C5H7NO2 + 3 CO2 + 6 H2O + Energy organic cellular matter matter (3.9) In this equation, CH2O represents the organic matter, in the same way that the equivalent formulation C6H12O6 was also used to represent organic matter in Item 3.2.1. The cellular matter is expressed by the following empirical formula C5H7NO2 (see Section 1.7.2). • Subsequent stage: predominance of endogenous respiration (catabolism) When the organic matter originally present in the wastewater is mostly re- moved, there is the predominance of the mechanisms of the second phase of oxidation. At the start of this phase, the microorganisms’ population is at their maximum and, due to the low availability of substrate in the medium, the main food source becomes their own cellular protoplasm. Therefore, in this phase there is the predominance of auto-oxidation mechanisms or endogenous respiration (see Section 3.4, about bacterial growth). The sim- pliﬁed representative equation of this phase is: C5H7NO2 cellular matter + 5 O2 −→5 CO2 + NH3 + 2 H2O + Energy (3.10)",

The sim- pliﬁed representative equation of this phase is: C5H7NO2 cellular matter + 5 O2 −→5 CO2 + NH3 + 2 H2O + Energy (3.10) Naturally in a system with mixed cultures, such as the reactors used in biological wastewater treatment, there are microorganisms with different growth and decay rates. Consequently, some microorganism species can be in one stage of synthesis or endogenous respiration, while other species are in earlier or later phases. The representation above regards only average conditions for heterotrophic microor- ganisms in the reactor. The total oxygen consumed in both phases is deﬁned as the ultimate oxygen demand (BODu). The addition of equations 3.9 and 3.10 leads to the simpliﬁed equation for the oxidation of the organic matter (identical to Equation 3.1): CH2O + O2−→CO2 + H2O + Energy (3.11) The value of the theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) based on the stoichiomet- ric relations of Equation 3.11 differs, in a certain way, from what is found for the ultimate demand, being, in reality, a little higher. This is because in the endoge- nous phase, when a bacteria dies, it becomes food for other bacteria, and thus a subsequent transformation to carbon dioxide, water and cellular material occurs. The living as well as the dead bacteria serve as food for higher organisms, such as protozoa. In each transformation, a new oxidation occurs, but in the general balance, a certain fraction of the organic matter, resistant to biological attack, re- mains. This fraction is the one responsible for the deviation between the values of the theoretical and the ultimate oxygen demand (Sawyer and Mc Carty, 1978). The removal and oxidation of the organic matter present in the wastewater (ﬁrst phase) normally has a duration of one to two days. The total oxidation of the cellular mass will take a very long time, but, in practical terms for domestic sewage, it can be considered complete around 20 days. The reaction rate in the assimilation phase is several times higher than in the second phase, of endogenous respiration (Eckenfelder, 1980).

    "text_to_embed": "3.4 PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIAL GROWTH 3.4.1 Synthesis and endogenous respiration As already mentioned, heterotrophic organisms use organic matter as a form of condensed energy that is necessary for their various metabolic processes, including growth and reproduction. With the use of oxygen (aerobic conditions – Equation 3.1) or another electron acceptor (e.g. nitrate, in anoxic conditions – Equation 3.8), these organisms oxidise the organic matter, with the production of more cellular matter (growth and reproduction) and energy release. This is the synthesis phase. If the substrate available in the medium starts to become scarce, such as in sewage treatment, in which organic matter is progressively removed, the microorganisms need to ﬁnd other organic matter or condensed energy sources. The main substrate directly available is their own cellular protoplasm, which the cells start to use according to Equation 3.10. In this stage, the balance is negative, that is, there is a reduction in the cellular matter or the bacterial concentration in the medium, characterising the endogenous respiration stage. It is thus seen that there is a close relation between the substrate concentration in the medium, or the available food, and the microorganisms’ population. When the availability of organic matter is sufﬁcient, the bacteria are in a growing phase, and when it becomes insufﬁcient, the bacteria enter a decreasing stage. This con- sideration is of large importance in sewage treatment, in which systems can be designed to operate with a high or low organic matter supply for the bacteria. Besides, the form in which the two phases are located in the biological reactor depends on its hydraulic conﬁguration (see Chapter 2). In a plug-ﬂow reactor, the reaction time is associated with the physical location in the reactor. Hence, the sequencing between the two phases can take place along the inlet and outlet of the reactor. In a complete-mix reactor, the concentration of the substrate and the bacteria are the same at any point in the reactor. Thus, the relative predominance of one phase or another will depend on the prevalent concentration of the substrate in the reactor. If it is high, the synthesis phase prevails in the reactor as a whole. However, if the substrate concentration is low, the balance favours the mechanisms of endogenous respiration.

Naturally, in practice the growth is soon restricted due to the exhaustion of the nutrients in the medium. When inoculating a liquid volume with a certain initial quantity of bacterial cells and a limited quantity of substrate, the number of bacteria will progress with time according to the typical bacterial growth-curve, expressed in Figure 3.7 (vertical logarithmic scale). • Lag phase.

This phase can be reduced in the case of typical domestic sewage, in which the bacteria have already acquired the necessary enzymatic equipment. • Exponential-growth phase. In the exponential growth phase the cells divide themselves at a constant rate. Plotted on a logarithmic scale, the number of cells grows linearly, justifying the alternative designation of logarithmic phase. There is an excess of the substrate in the medium, al- lowing the growth rate to reach its maximum, with the only limitation by the microorganisms’ capacity to process the substrate. In parallel with the maximum growth rate, there is also the maximum substrate removal rate. • Stationary phase. The stationary phase is when the food starts to be scarce in the medium, and the bacterial growth rate is equal to the death rate. Therefore, the number of cells is maintained temporally constant. • Decline or decay phase.In the decline or decay phase, the availability of the substrate in the medium is reduced. In these conditions, endogenous respiration prevails, and the bacteria are forced to use their own cellular protoplasm as a substrate source. The dying cells allow their nutrients to diffuse into the medium, serving as food to other cells. The death rate is exponential and constant, leading to a straight line on the logarithmic scale. As already mentioned, it is important to emphasise that this representation of the growth regards a single population of microorganisms growing at the expense of a single type of substrate. In reality, in the biological reactor of a sewage treat- ment works, there is a variety of microorganisms metabolising a variety of com- pounds.Hence,there will be an overlapping of various curves of different forms and types, developing at different times. This interaction characterises the ecology of wastewater treatment, covered in Chapter 1. The design and operation of a sewage treatment plant uses these concepts of bacterial growth to place the operation inside a desired range. A generalisation is difﬁcult due to the large variety of microorganisms and substrates that occur in practice, but the following tendencies can be observed: • Very high loading systems. In the exponential growth phase, the substrate availability is high. This indicates that the concentration of the substrate (e.g. BOD) in the efﬂuent will also be somewhat high. Thus, the majority of sewage treatment systems do not operate in this phase. • High loading systems (e.g. conventional activated sludge, high rate trick- ling ﬁlters).

The reasoning of these systems is to supply a minimum quantity of substrate to the organisms, in order to stimulate endogenous respiration. This leads to a self metabolism of the microorganisms, that is, they undergo a digestion of the cellular mass in the reactor itself.

The net growth rate is equal to the gross growth rate minus the bacterial decay rate. The growth rate of a bacterial population is a function of its number, mass or concentration at a given time. Mathematically, this relation can be expressed as: dX dt = µ.X (3.12) where: X = concentration of the microorganisms in the reactor, SS or VSS (g/m3) µ = speciﬁc growth rate (d−1) t = time (d) This formula, if integrated, assumes an exponential form, which, when plotted on a logarithmic scale, results in a straight line. This is the logarithmic phase shown in Figure 3.7. The growth rate, such as expressed by Equation 3.12, is for a growth without limitation of substrate. However, it was seen in the previous sections that bacterial growth is a function of the availability of the substrate in the medium. When the substrate is present at a low concentration, the growth rate is proportionally low. In sewage treatment, the carbonaceous matter is usually the limiting growth factor. The speciﬁc growth rate µ must be therefore expressed as a function of the sub- strate concentration. Monod, in his classic studies with bacterial cultures, presented this relation according to the following empirical formula: µ = µ max. S Ks + S (3.13) where: µ max = maximum speciﬁc growth rate (d−1) S = concentration of the limiting substrate or nutrient (g/m3) Ks = half-saturation coefﬁcient, which is deﬁned as the substrate concentra- tion for which µ = µ max/2 (g/m3) Figure 3.8 shows a graphic representation of this equation. The limiting nutrient (S) is the one that, in case its concentration is reduced, will lead to a decrease in the population growth rate (as indicated in the ﬁgure through the reduction of µ). Conversely, if the concentration of S starts to increase, the population will consequently increase. However, if S continues to increase, there will be a point in",

Conversely, if the concentration of S starts to increase, the population will consequently increase. However, if S continues to increase, there will be a point in which it will be in excess in the medium, not being anymore the limiting factor for the population growth. In these conditions, another nutrient will probably start to control the growth, becoming the new limiting factor. This explains why µ tends to a maximum value, expressed by µ max. At this point, even if the concentration S increases, µ will not increase further, since it is no longer limited by S. The basis of the Monod formulation are analysed in Chapter 1. The interpretation of the half-saturation coefﬁcient Ks is that, when the substrate concentration in the medium is equal to Ks (Ks = S), the term S/(Ks + S) of Equation 3.13 becomes equal to 1/2. Thus, the growth rate µ becomes equal to half the maximum rate (µ max/2). To compare different substrates, the value of Ks gives an indication of the non-afﬁnity of the microorganisms for each substrate: the greater the value of Ks, the lower the growth rate µ or, else, the lower the afﬁnity of the biomass to the substrate. To obtain high substrate removals in sewage treatment, it is desirable that the substrate has low values of Ks. In the case of the heterotrophic bacteria involved in sewage treatment, the limiting substrate is usually organic carbon or, in other words, BOD or COD. This is because the reactors work with low organic carbon concentrations to produce an efﬂuent with a low BOD concentration. Under other conditions, there can be other limiting nutrients, or even a compo- sition of two or more of them. This is the case of the growth rate of the nitrifying organisms. Due to the fact that their growth rate is small, either with low ammonia values as well as with low dissolved oxygen values, the Monod relation can be ex- pressedasadouble-inhibitionfunction.Hence,insteadofonlyonetermS/(Ks +S), there is the product of two terms [S1/ (Ks1 + S1]. [S2/ (Ks2 + S2], in which S1and S2 are the concentrations of the two limiting factors (in this case, ammonia and oxygen).

In the laboratory, the curve in Figure 3.8 (or a transformation of it) can be constructed, and the values of Ks and µ max can be extracted. In domestic sewage treatment, values of Ks and µ max in the following ranges have been reported: • Aerobic treatment (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991): µ max = 1.2 to 6 d−1 Ks = 25 to 100 mg BOD5/l or Ks =15 to 70 mgCOD/l • Anaerobic treatment (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994; Chernicharo, 1997): µ max = 2.0 d−1 (acidogenic organisms) µ max = 0.4 d−1 (methanogenic organisms) µ max = 0.4 d−1 (combined biomass) Ks ≈200 mgCOD/l (acidogenic organisms) Ks ≈50 mgCOD/l (methanogenic organisms) Certain types of organisms could of course have different coefﬁcients from these global values. The Monod equation has the same form as the Michaelis–Menten equation for enzymatic relations (see Chapter 1). However, while the latter is based on theoretical principles, the Monod relation is essentially empirical. Another aspect is that the Monod equation was derived for a single organism metabolising a single substrate. However, in wastewater treatment this assumption is not valid, since there is a multiple population assimilating a multiple substrate. Due to these aspects, the Monod relation has been the target of criticism from the specialised literature. However, a more satisfactory relation has not yet been developed, and the Monod equation maintains its importance, being adopted in practically all mathematical models of biological wastewater treatment. A great advantage of the Monod equation resides in its structure that permits the representation in a continuous form of the range of variation between the extremes of lack and abundance of nutrients in the medium. Therefore, depending on the value of S, the Monod equation can represent approximately the kinetics of zero and ﬁrst orders, as well as the transition between them. In the case of a substrate removal reaction, when its concentration is still high and not limiting, the global removal rate approaches the zero-order kinetics.

When the substrate concentration is very low, the reaction rate starts to be limited by its low availability in the medium. In these conditions, the reaction kinetics approach ﬁrst order. These two situations occur depending on the relative values of S and Ks, as described below: • Relative substrate concentration: high S >> Ks • reaction approximately zero order • growth rate µ independent of S When the substrate concentration is much higher than the value of Ks, Ks can be neglected in the denominator of Equation 3.13, which is re- duced to: µ = µ max (3.14) In these conditions, the growth rate µ is constant and equal to the maximum rate µ max. The reaction follows a zero-order kinetics, in which the reaction rate is independent from the substrate concentration. In domestic sewage treatment, this situation tends to occur at the head of a plug-ﬂow reactor, where the substrate concentration is still high. • Relative substrate concentration: low S << Ks • reaction approximately ﬁrst order • growth rate µ is dependent on S (directly proportional) When the substrate concentration is much lower than the value of Ks, S can be neglected in the denominator of Equation 3.13, which is reduced to: µ = µ max.

However, since the bacteria stay in the treatment systems for more than one or two days, there is also the endogenous metabolism stage. This implies that part of the cellular matter is destroyed by means of some of the mechanisms active in the endogenous respiration stage. To obtain the net growth rate, this loss should be discounted, which is also a function of the concentration or bacterial mass. For accuracy, only the biodegradable fraction of the biomass should be considered, since there is also an inert, non-biodegradable organic fraction, not subject to bacterial decay. For simplicity, the total VSS are considered in most of this chapter, and not the biodegradable VSS. In the chapters related to the activated sludge system, this concept is deepened, and the concept of the biodegradable fraction is used.

The anaerobic conversion of the organic substrate releases less energy and therefore the value of Y is lower, indi- cating a lower biomass production. The nitrifying bacteria (chemoautotrophs) do not extract their energy from the organic carbon, but from the oxidation of inor- ganic compounds. Thus, they also present lower Y values when compared with the aerobic heterotrophic organisms (Arceivala, 1981). 3.4.4.2 Net solids production Equation 3.20 expresses the gross bacterial growth without taking into considera- tion the reduction of the biomass due to endogenous respiration.

One of the characteristics of the ideal complete-mix reactor is that the efﬂuent leaves with the same concentration as in the liquid in any part of the reactor. This implies that the values of S and X are the same in the reactor, as well as in the efﬂuent. X is the concentration of the solids. In the reactor, these solids are mainly biological solids, represented by the biomass (microorganisms) produced in the reactor at the expense of the available substrate. In contrast, in the inﬂuent to the reactor, the solids are those present in the wastewater, and the presence of biological solids is frequently neglected in the general mass balance. For simplicity, it is usually considered that X0 = 0 mg/L (although this assumption does not apply in all situations). Two mass balances can be done, one for the substrate and the other for the biomass. These mass balances are essential for design and operational control of the biological reactor, and are detailed in this section. So = concentration of the total influent substrate (BOD or COD) (mg/L or g/m3) S = concentration of the soluble effluent substrate (BOD or COD) (mg/L or g/m3) Q = flow (m3/d) X = concentration of the suspended solids in the reactor (mg/L or g/m3) Xo = concentration of influent suspended solids (mg/L or g/m3) V = reactor volume (m3) Figure 3.10.

The other systems are covered in the present section. 3.5.2.2 Reactor with a ﬁnal sedimentation unit and without solids recirculation When analysing Figure 3.10, it can be observed that the biological solids formed are present in the efﬂuent in the same concentration as in the reactor. These solids are, ultimately, largely composed by organic matter and, if discharged into the receiving body, would undergo stabilisation similarly to the other forms of organic matter. Therefore, even that the soluble BOD may have undergone a substantial reduction in the reactor, the particulate BOD represented by the biological solids in the efﬂuent can be responsible for the deterioration in the quantity of the efﬂuent. Based on this concept, various treatment systems incorporate a settling unit after the reactor in order to retain the biological solids and avoid that they reach the receiving body in the same concentration as found in the reactor. A system with a settling unit is shown in Figure 3.11. The inclusion of a ﬁnal settling unit results in a great improvement in the ﬁnal efﬂuent quality, thanks to the tendency presented by the bacteria responsible for the stabilisation of the organic matter to ﬂocculate and settle. Thus, they have not just the property of removing BOD with efﬁciency, but they can be also removed by simple solid-liquid separation operations, such as sedimentation. The capacity of a system in the removal of organic matter depends on the quantity of biomass present in the reactor. In the above system, the biomass con- centration is limited by the quantity of substrate available in the inﬂuent: if the substrate increases, the bacteria population growth rate will increase, according to Monod kinetics, until a maximum limit given by µ max. Hence, for a given substrate, the biomass concentration does not go above a certain maximum value. 3.5.2.3 Reactor with a ﬁnal sedimentation unit and with solids recirculation The sludge accumulated up to a certain period at the bottom of the settling unit consists mainly of bacteria that are still active in terms of their capacity to assimilate organic matter.

Biological reactor with recirculation of solids the removal of the organic matter, based on the fact that, the greater the biomass concentration, the greater the substrate utilisation or, in other words, the greater the BOD removal. Therefore, if the settled sludge is returned, with a concentration higher than in the reactor, the system will be able to assimilate a much higher BOD load. This recirculation has also the important role of increasing the average time in which the microorganisms remain in the system. The recirculation of biomass is the basic principle of systems, such as activated sludge (accomplished by a recirculation pumping station) and UASB reactors (reached by the return of solids that settled in the sedimentation tank, situated above the digestion compartment). Figure 3.12 illustrates the concept of a system with sludge return. The value of Xr is higher than X, that is,the return sludge has a greater suspended solids concentration, what allows the increase of SS concentration in the reactor. In Figure 3.12 there is another ﬂow line, which corresponds to the excess sludge (also called surplus sludge, biological sludge or waste sludge). This is based on the concept that the biomass production (bacterial growth) must be compensated for by the wastage of an equivalent quantity, for the system to be maintained in equilibrium. If there were no such a wastage, the mass of suspended solids in the reactor would progressively increase, and these solids would then be transferred to the settling tank, until a point when the settler would become overloaded. In this situation, the settling tank would not be capable of transferring the solids to the bottom, and the sludge blanket level would rise and eventually the solids would start to escape in the ﬁnal efﬂuent, thus deteriorating its quality. There- fore, in a simpliﬁed way, it can be said that the production of solids must be counterbalanced by an equivalent wastage of solids (mass per unit time). The excess sludge ﬂow is very small compared with the inﬂuent and return sludge ﬂows.",

There- fore, in a simpliﬁed way, it can be said that the production of solids must be counterbalanced by an equivalent wastage of solids (mass per unit time). The excess sludge ﬂow is very small compared with the inﬂuent and return sludge ﬂows. All biological treatment systems produce excess sludge. In the complete-mix systems without recirculation (Figure 3.10), the excess sludge leaves with the ﬁnal efﬂuent. In other systems (usually with large reactor volumes), the sludge remains stored in the system and is only removed after large time intervals. The system represented in Figure 3.11 could be according to this concept (e.g. complete-mix aerated lagoons followed by sedimentation ponds) or it could include a separate line for the continuous or periodic removal of the excess sludge. 3.5.3 Hydraulic detention time and solids retention time In a system with solids recycling, such as in Figure 3.12, the solids are separated and concentrated in the ﬁnal settling unit and subsequently returned to the reactor. The liquid, on the other hand, in spite of the recirculation (which is internal in the system), does not vary quantitatively, apart from the withdrawal of the excess sludge ﬂow, which is negligible in the overall calculation (Qex ≈0). Therefore, only the solids are retained in the system, owing to the separation, thickening and recycling. Thus, the solids remain longer in the system than the liquid. It is thus necessary to distinguish the concepts of solids retention time and hydraulic detention time. Other treatment systems retain solids without the need of separate settling tanks (e.g. sequencing batch reactors) or recycle pumps (e.g. sequencing batch reactors, UASB reactors). The hydraulic detention time t (or hydraulic retention time – HRT) given by: hydraulic detention time = volume of liquid in the system /volume of liquid removed per unit time (3.30) Since the volume of liquid that enters is the same as the one that leaves, the following generalisation can be made: t = V / Q (3.31) Similarly, the solids retention time SRT (or mean cell residence time – MCRT or sludge age - θc) is given by: sludge age = mass of solids in the system / mass of solids produced per unit time (3.32) In the steady state, the quantity of solids removed from the system is equal to the quantity of sludge produced. Hence, the sludge age can also be expressed as: sludge age = mass of solids in the system / mass of solids removed per unit time (3.33)",

It can also be said that, for the same removal efﬁciency, systems with solids recirculation require much smaller reactor volumes than the systems without recirculation. In all the above analyses, the following simplifying hypotheses have been adopted: • The biochemical reactions occur only in the reactor. The reactions of the conversion of organic matter and of cellular growth in the settling unit can be neglected, when compared with those that occur in the reactor. The error resulting from this simpliﬁcation can be considered negligible. • The biomass is assumed to be present only in the reactor. In the calculation of the sludge age, the solids present in the ﬁnal settling unit and in the recirculation line have not been considered.

This hypothesis greatly simpliﬁes the real situation that occurs in a wastewater treatment plant, in which the true steady state will practically never occur. The con- tinuous variation of the inﬂuent characteristics (throughout the day) is responsible for the predominance of the dynamic state in operation, with mass accumulations occurring in the reactor and settling tank. However, if the system is analysed in a broad time scale, these variations become less important. Thus, it can be said that, for designing or operational planning in long time horizons, the steady state assumption can be accepted. On the other hand, for the operation of a plant in a short time scale, the predomi- nance of the dynamic state must be taken into consideration, and the above relations cannot be used as such. In the dynamic state, the mass of solids produced is not equal to the mass wasted, which alters the interpretation of the sludge age concept. • The inﬂuence of the solids in the inﬂuent sewage was not considered. This is a simplifying assumption adopted in most books, but it can be far from re- ality in some sewage treatment plants with a lower production of biological solids.",

If not, the cell is going to be washed out of the system before it has time to multiply itself, leading to a progressive reduction in the biomass concentration in the reactor, until the system collapses. As previously seen, the reproduction of bacteria is by binary ﬁssion, and the net speciﬁc growth rate is as seen in Section 3.4.3: dX dt = (µ −Kd).X (3.37) or dX X = (µ −Kd).dt (3.38) The integration of this equation within the limits of t = 0 and t = t leads to: ln X Xo = (µ −Kd).t (3.39) where: X = number or bacterial concentration at a time t X0 = number or bacterial concentration at a time t = 0 This is the exponential growth phase, which, if plotted on a logarithmic scale, gives a straight line.

In this case, θc (= t) needs to be greater than or equal to tdup. This condition needs to be satisﬁed in the case, for instance, of complete-mix aerated lagoons. In these lagoons, it is essential to ensure that the minimum hydraulic detention time is not less than the bacterial doubling time, at critical temperature conditions. In the design of units such as ponds in series, the minimum size of each pond is dictated by this requirement. • Systems with suspended biomass, with recirculation (θc > t). In these sys- tems, the excess sludge ﬂow can be adjusted in order to maintain θc > tdup, while the hydraulic detention time t can be maintained at a minimum (min- imum volume of the reactor). Consequently, the sludge recirculation is a way of increasing θc without necessarily increasing t (or V). For the aerobic removal of the carbonaceous matter, the solids retention time of the heterotrophic bacteria is usually much higher than the minimum time required. However, for the methanogenesis in anaerobic systems, as well as for the oxidation of ammonia in aerobic systems, greater care must be exercised. The reproduction rate of the methanogenic and nitrifying organisms is very slow and there is the risk of their wash-out of the system if the inﬂuent ﬂow increases substantially or if their reproduction rate is reduced due to some environmental problem. 3.5.5 Concentration of suspended solids in the reactor To obtain the biomass concentration in the reactor of a system with solids re- circulation, equations 3.21 and 3.34 can be rearranged, assuming steady-state conditions: X = Y.(So −S) 1 + Kd.θc . θc t  (3.42) This equation is very important for the estimation of the solids concentration in a complete-mix reactor, once the other parameters or variables are known or have been estimated.

Consequently, Equation 3.42 is reduced to: X = Y.(So −S) 1 + Kd.t (3.43) It can be observed that the difference between both equations is the factor (θc/t), which exerts a multiplying factor on Equation 3.43, in the sense of increasing the suspended solids concentration in the reactor. In the design of a wastewater treatment plant, any increase in X allows a proportional decrease in the volume required for the reactor. Example 3.4 illustrates the calculation of the biomass concentration in a system without recirculation, while Example 3.5 shows the advantage of the recirculation in terms of the reduction of the reactor volume.

An interesting aspect of this equation is that, mathemat- ically, in a complete-mix system, the efﬂuent BOD concentration S is independent of the inﬂuent concentration So (Arceivala, 1981). This is because Ks, Kd and µ max are constants and therefore S depends only on the sludge age θc. This can be un- derstood by the fact that, the greater the inﬂuent BOD, the greater is the production of biological solids, and, as a result, the greater is the biomass concentration Xv. Thus, when there is more food, there is a greater availability for the bacteria to assimilate it. It must be emphasised that this consideration is applicable only in the steady state. In the dynamic state, the increases in the inﬂuent BOD are not imme- diately followed by the corresponding increase in the biomass, since the process of biomass increase is slow. Hence, until a new equilibrium state is reached (if it will be reached at all), the efﬂuent quality, in terms of BOD, will be deteriorated. Theoretically, the minimum concentration of soluble substrate that can be reached in a system is when the sludge age θc tends to inﬁnity. In these con- ditions, the term 1/θc is equal to zero. By substituting 1/θc for 0 in Equation 3.47, an equation that deﬁnes the minimum possible soluble efﬂuent BOD (Smin) is found. If in a treatment system it is necessary to obtain a value lower than Smin, it will not be possible with only one complete-mix reactor (Grady & Lim, 1980). Smin is independent on the existence of recirculation and is only a function of the kinetic coefﬁcients. Smin = Ks.Kd µ max −Kd (3.48)",

Smin = Ks.Kd µ max −Kd (3.48) 3.5.7 Loading rates on biological reactors 3.5.7.1 Sludge load (food-to-microorganism ratio) A relationship widely used by designers and operators of wastewater treatment plants is the sludge load or F/M (food-to-microorganism) ratio. It is based on the concept that the quantity of food or substrate available per unit mass of mi- croorganisms is related to the efﬁciency of the system. Hence, it can be understood that, the higher the BOD load supplied per unit value of the biomass (high F/M ratio), the lower is the substrate assimilation efﬁciency, but, on the other hand, the lower is the required reactor volume. Conversely, when less BOD is supplied to the bacteria (low F/M ratio), the demand for food is higher, which implies a greater BOD removal efﬁciency and a larger reactor volume requirement. In a situation in which the quantity of food supplied is very low, the mechanism of endogenous respiration becomes prevalent, which is a characteristic of low-rate (e.g. extended aeration) systems. The food load supplied is given by: F = Q.S0 (3.49) The microorganism mass is calculated as: M = V.Xv (3.50) where: Q = inﬂuent ﬂow (m3/d) S0 = inﬂuent BOD5 concentration (g/m3) V = reactor volume (m3) Xv = volatile suspended solids concentration (g/m3)",

Care must be exercised when analysing values, in order not to mix nomenclatures and forms of expression. There is a relationship between VSS and SS, which is a function of the sludge age. High sludge ages (low F/M ratios) imply higher removals of the organic fraction, represented by the volatile suspended solids, leading to a lower VSS/SS ratio. Each wastewater treatment system has typical values of the VSS/SS ratio predominant in the biological reactor. The relation Q/V in Equation 3.51 can be substituted by 1/t, which leads to another way of presenting the F/M ratio: F M = So t.Xv (3.52) Accurately speaking, the F/M ratio has no direct association with the removal of the organic matter that really occurs in the reactor, since the F/M ratio constitutes only a representation of the applied (or available) load. The formula that expresses the relation between the available and the removed substrates is the substrate utilisation rate (U). In U, instead of including only So, the relation So −S is included: U = Q.(So −S) V.Xv (3.53) where: S = soluble efﬂuent BOD5 concentration (g/m3) Hence, it can be said that: U = (F/M).E (3.54) where: E = substrate removal efﬁciency of the system = (So −S)/So Because the substrate removal efﬁciencies in sewage treatment systems are usually high and not far from the unity, it can be said that U ≈F/M.",

Analysing Equation 3.53, it can be seen that, after deﬁning the design value for F/M (or U), adopting a value for Xv, and knowing the ﬂow Q and the inﬂuent So and efﬂuent S (desired) BOD concentrations, the necessary volume for the reactor can be calculated.

According to Equation 3.34, the ﬁrst part of Equation 3.58 is equal to 1/θc. Hence: 1 θc = Y. So −S Xv.t  −Kd.fb (3.59) According to Equation 3.53, the term in brackets is the substrate utilisation rate (U). Therefore, in the steady state: 1 θc = Y.U −Kd.fb (3.60) Since U = (F/M).E, Equation 3.60 can also be also expressed as: 1 θc = Y.  F M  .E −Kd.fb (3.61) Therefore, Equations 3.60 and 3.61 correlate θc and U (or F/M), once the values of the coefﬁcients Y and Kd have been adopted. Thus, knowing θc, U can be calculated (or F/M), or vice-versa. Equations 3.60 and 3.61 are presented in various texts in terms of XV, without considering that only part of XV is biodegradable. Hence, the correct is to express the decay in terms of Xb, or of fb.Xv, since fb = Xb/Xv, where Xb is the concen- tration of the biodegradable volatile suspended solids and fb is the biodegradable fraction of VSS. The reason for the consideration of Xb is reinforced by the following point. In systems with a high sludge age, such as the extended aeration activated sludge, if Equations 3.60 and 3.61 were presented without fb, certain indeterminations could be generated (not present in conventional texts, because most of them are dedicated to systems with a conventional sludge age). When substituting Y and Kd by typical values in the literature and adopting F/M values representative of extended aeration, a negative value of 1/θc (negative net sludge production) is obtained. Such incongruence occurs because the values of Y and Kd expressed in the literature are mainly associated to determinations undertaken in systems with a conventional sludge age. A solution for this problem is the adoption of coefﬁcient values resulting from laboratory tests under operational conditions similar to those expected in practice. The main discrepancy found in long sludge age systems is becauseofthefactthat,giventhelowsubstrateavailabilityprevalentinthemedium, a predominance of endogenous respiration occurs, which causes a decrease of the biodegradable fraction of the volatile solids.

The concept of fb is detailed in Section 3.5.8 The selection of the Kd value should also reﬂect the representation of the biomass. The values of Kd usually reported in the literature are associated with the decay of Xv. In this text, when representing the decay in terms of the biodegradable solids, Kd assumes higher values than usually found in the literature, because it will be subsequently multiplied by fb. When multiplying the proposed values of fb and Kd, in a system with a conventional sludge age, the results obtained correspond to the usual values of Kd, found in the literature. The present approach, described by Eckenfelder (1989), allows the generali- sation of systems such as activated sludge for the conventional as well as for the extended aeration mode. There are even more sophisticated models, such as those of the IWA (2000) – ASM1-1987, ASM2-1995, ASM3-2000 – based on the active fraction of the biomass. These models, in spite of their great explanatory power, scientiﬁcally based structure and wide acceptance, are more complex, being out- side of the more general scope of this book. However, readers who want to deepen their knowledge into the mechanisms of C, N and P removal, are encouraged to consult these references, especially the latter, which is a consolidation of the previous two. 3.5.7.3 Volumetric organic load Some sewage treatment systems are designed according to the volumetric organic load, which is represented by the equation: LVO = Q.So V (3.62) where: LVO = volumetric organic load (gBOD/m3.d) Since Q/V is equal to 1/t, Equation 3.62 can be rewritten as: LVO = So t (3.63) Adopting a value for LVO, the required reactor volume can be calculated through the rearrangement of Equation 3.62: V = Q.So LVO (3.64) It can be observed that the volumetric organic load differs from the F/M ratio by the fact that the former represents the load applied per unit reactor volume, while the latter represents the load applied per unit of biomass in the reactor.",

In these reactors, the surface area plays a more important role than the volume itself. In the case of facultative ponds, it is through the surface area that the sunlight penetrates in the pond and allows the development of the required photosynthetic activity. Surface loading rates are expressed as: LS = Q.So A (3.66) where: LS = surface organic load (kgBOD/m2.d or kgBOD/ha.d) A = surface area (m2 or ha)",

In the volatile solids, there is a fraction, which is non-biodegradable (inert) (Xnb), resulting from residues of endogenous respiration, and a biodegradable fraction (Xb). Thus: Xv = Xnb + Xb (3.68) The sludge recirculation leads to an accumulation of the inorganic fraction Xi, as well as the non-biodegradable fraction Xnb in the system, since they are not affected by the biological treatment. The higher the sludge age, the lower the ratio Xb/Xv. This can be understood by the fact that at higher sludge ages there is the predominance of endogenous respiration with a greater self-oxidation of the cellular material, that is, stabilisation of the sludge The volatile solids shortly after being produced (θc = 0) are approximately 20% inert and 80% biodegradable. With their stay in the reactor (θc > 0), the ratio Xb/Xv decreases. The ratio Xb/Xv (= fb) can be expressed as (Eckenfelder, 1989): fb = f ′ b 1 + (1 −f ′ b).Kd.θc (3.69) where: fb = biodegradable fraction of the VSS generated in the system, submitted to a sludge age θc (Xb/Xv) f ′ b = biodegradable fraction of the VSS immediately after their generation in the system, that is, with θc = 0. This value is typically equal to 0.8 (= 80%) For the various values of Kd and sludge age, Table 3.1 presents the fb values resulting from Equation 3.69. The values of fb are used in various formulas in the activated sludge process, such as those related with the sludge production, oxygen consumption by the biomass and BOD associated with the suspended solids in the efﬂuent.

The values presented in Table 3.1 are only related to the biological solids pro- duced in the reactor. Raw sewage also contributes with ﬁxed solids and volatile, non-biodegradable and biodegradable solids. Approximate values of the main relationships in raw sewage are (WEF/ASCE, 1992; Metcalf & Eddy, 1991): Raw sewage: • VSS/TSS = 0.70 −0.85 • SSi/TSS = 0.15 −0.30 • SSb/VSS = 0.6 • SSnb/VSS = 0.4 The load relative to the contribution of these raw sewage solids should be taken into account, especially the inorganic and non-biodegradable organic fractions, which do not undergo transformation in the biological treatment. The load of biodegradable solids need not be taken into separate consideration, since these solids will be absorbed in the biological ﬂocs in the reactor, where they will be hydrolysed and subsequently degraded, thus generating new biological solids and an oxygen consumption (in aerobic systems). Since this contribution is already included in the biological solids generated due to the inﬂuent BOD, the SSb of the raw sewage should not be calculated separately. In systems with primary settling, the fraction of the raw sewage solids that is removed by sedimentation and do not enter the biological reactor should be discounted. The active fraction of the volatile solids, that is, the fraction that is really responsible for the decomposition of the carbonaceous organic matter, is given by (IAWPRC, 1987; WEF/ASCE, 1992): fa = 1 1 + (1 −f ′ b).Kd.θc (3.70) where: fa = active fraction of the volatile suspended solids (Xa/Xv)",

However, in the present book, the more conventional and simpler version of expressing the solids by VSS is adopted. During the treatment, there is the generation and destruction of solids. This section presents below the various formulas related to the creation and destruction of the various types of solids present in the reactor (excluding the solids of the inﬂuent wastewater). The gross production of volatile suspended solids (Pxv) is a result of the multiplication of the yield coefﬁcient by the BOD5 load removed: Pxv gross = Y.Q.(S0 −S) (3.72) From the suspended solids recently formed in the reactor, approximately 90% are organic (volatile) and 10% are inorganic (ﬁxed) (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991), leading to the ratio VSS/TSS = 0.9 in the recently formed biological solids. With this ratio, the recently produced TSS load can be estimated (gross production of total suspended solids, without including destruction): Px gross = Pxv/0.9 (3.73) As a result, the production of ﬁxed suspended solids is: Pxi = Px gross −Pxv gross (3.74) Not all the volatile solids produced are biodegradable. Immediately after pro- duction (θc = 0), the load of the biodegradable solids produced is equal to the product of the volatile solids produced (Pxv) by the biodegradable fraction of the solids recently formed (f ′ b). It was seen above that typical values of f ′ b are around 0.8. The determination of this load of recently formed biodegradable suspended solids has little practical value, since the solids remain in the reactor for a time greater than θc. Only as an illustration, the formula for its calculation is presented below: Pxb recently formed = (Pxv gross).f ′ b (3.75) As a result of the time that the solids remain in the reactor (θc), the biodegrad- ability fraction fb decreases. Hence, the gross production of biodegradable",

Hence, the gross production of biodegradable suspended solids submitted to a detention time θc is equal to Pxv gross mul- tiplied by the biodegradability fraction fb. As seen above, fb is a function of θc (Equation 3.69). Pxb gross = (Pxv gross).fb (3.76) The production of non-biodegradable volatile suspended solids (inert or endogenous) is obtained by the difference between the gross production of Xv and the gross production of Xb: Pxnb = Pxv gross −Pxb gross (3.77) The gross production of the active fraction of the volatile suspended solids is given by: Pxa gross = (Pxv gross).fb/f ′ b (3.78) Owing to endogenous respiration, part of the biodegradable solids are destroyed in the reactor. The load of the biodegradable suspended solids destroyed is a function of the sludge age, and is given by: Pxb destroyed = (Pxb gross).(Kd..θc)/(1 + fb.Kd.θc) (3.79) Therefore, the net production of biodegradable suspended solids is: Pxb net = Pxb gross −Pxb destroyed (3.80) The net production of volatile suspended solids is equal to the net produc- tion of biodegradable solids plus the production of non-biodegradable organic solids. Pxv net = Pxb net + Pxnb (3.81) The net production of the volatile suspended solids can also be obtained by using the concept of the observed yield (Yobs).

As men- tioned above, it is not necessary to sum the contribution of the biodegradable solids of the inﬂuent wastewater, due to the fact that they are already included in the inﬂuent BOD. The inﬂuent BOD comprises the soluble BOD5 fraction as well as the particulate BOD5 fraction (resulting from the inﬂuent biodegradable solids). Consequently, the transformation of the total BOD5 into biodegradable solids indirectly incorporates the contribution of the biodegradable solids from the inﬂuent wastewater. Example 3.10 synthesises the relations described above for conventional and extended aeration activated sludge systems. In order to allow a comparison, the starting point in both cases is the removal of a BOD load equal to 100 kgBOD5/d. Hence, the values of the production and destruction, as well as the distribution of the solids, are referenced to a value of 100 units. In both situations, only the biological solids formed in the reactor are analysed and the contribution of the solids from the inﬂuent wastewater are not taken into consideration.",

In a tank in which the water ﬂow velocity is very low, the particles tend to go to the bottom under the inﬂuence of gravity. As a result, the supernatant liquid becomes clariﬁed, while the particles at the bottom form a sludge layer, and are then subsequently removed with the sludge. Sedimentation is a unit operation of high importance in various wastewater treatment systems. The main applications of sedimentation in wastewater treatment are: • Preliminarytreatment.Gritremoval(sedimentationofinorganicparticles of large dimensions) • Grit chamber • Primary treatment. Primary sedimentation (sedimentation of suspended solids from the raw sewage) • Conventional primary clariﬁers, with frequent sludge removal • Septic tanks • Secondary treatment.

Discrete settling occurs where the particles settle while maintaining their identity, meaning they do not coalesce, thus preserving their physical properties such as shape, size, and density, and an example application or occurrence is in Grit chambers. Flocculent settling involves particles coalescing while settling, changing their characteristics with an increase in size due to floc formation, which affects the settling velocity, and examples include Primary sedimentation tanks, the Upper part of secondary sedimentation tanks, and Chemical flocs in physical-chemical treatment. Hindered (or zone) settling takes place when there is a high concentration of solids, forming a sludge blanket which settles as a single mass where the particles tend to stay in a fixed position with relation to the neighbouring particles, allowing a clear separation interface to be observed between the solid phase and the liquid phase, with the interface level moving downwards as a result of the settling of the sludge blanket, and in this case, the settling velocity of the interface is what is used in the design of the settling tanks, with examples being Secondary sedimentation tanks and Sludge gravity thickeners. Compression settling occurs if the solids concentration is even higher, where settling could occur only by compression of the particles' structure, with the compression being due to the weight of the particles, constantly added because of the sedimentation of the particles situated in the supernatant liquid, and with the compression, part of the water is removed from the floc matrix, reducing its volume, examples of which are seen in the Bottom of secondary sedimentation tanks and Sludge gravity thickeners.

This terminal velocity is reached in the liquid medium in fractions of a second.

However, the variation in the density of the water within the usual temperature ranges in wastewater treatment can be neglected (999.8 kg/m3 and 992.2 kg/m3 for temperatures of 0 ◦C and 40 ◦C, respectively) and a value of 1000 kg/m3can be adopted. The inﬂuence on the water viscosity is more representative, as seen in Table 4.2 (Tchobanoglous and Schroeder, 1985; Huisman, 1978). Table 4.2.

As an example, when the particle diameter doubles, the settling velocity increases four times.",

Figure 4.5 shows the representative zones of this ideal tank. The theoretical considerations apply to the zone where settling effectively occurs (sedimentation zone). For the theoretical analysis of sedimentation, it is necessary to assume that: • the particles are uniformly distributed in the inlet zone • the particles that touch the sludge zone are considered removed • the particles that reach the outlet zone are not removed by sedimentation The main dimensions of the sedimentation zone are presented in Figure 4.6. In an ideal sedimentation tank with constant horizontal velocity, the discrete settling of a particle occurs as in a sedimentation column (see Figure 4.7). The time taken for a particle to reach the bottom is given by: • sedimentation column: time = distance/velocity t = H vs (4.3) • horizontal ﬂow tank: time = volume/ﬂow t = V Q = H.A Q (4.4)",

If it is desired to remove particles with settling velocities equal to or greater than vs, and knowing the wastewater ﬂow to be treated Q, the required surface area can be obtained from: A = Q vs (4.6) The settling velocity to be adopted for design (vs, or vo) is also called overﬂow rate or hydraulic surface loading rate, and is expressed in units of velocity (m/h), or ﬂow per unit area (m3/m2.h). In the interpretation of Equation 4.5, it should be noted that: • vs can be obtained through experiments with the liquid to be treated or from literature values (in a design, vs is a design parameter) • the removal of discrete particles depends only on the surface area (A) and not on the height (H) and time (t).

However, if the surface area A doubles, for example through the duplication of the length L, vh, and vs remain constant. The trajectory of the particle is not altered, but the particle is removed in half of the tank length (see Figure 4.9). Hence, this new tank is able to receive particles with settling velocities lower than vs. In summary, for the ideal discrete settling, the surface area A is of fundamental importance, while H and t do not play any role. The particles to be removed in a sedimentation tank depend on the: • settling velocity of the particle (compared with the design settling velocity vs) • height at which the particle enters the sedimentation zone In a tank removing particles originating from different vertical positions and with different settling velocities there are the possibilities shown in Table 3.2. 4.3.3 Discrete settling tests A large diversity of particle sizes occurs in a typical suspension of particulate matter. To determine the removal efﬁciency in a certain time, it is necessary to consider the whole range of the settling velocities found in the system.

If the initial concentration in the column at the initial time to = 0 is Co, and after a time ti, the concentration reduces to Ci at the depth zi, then Co −Ci of the original suspension has settling velocities greater then zi/ (ti −to). Repeating this concept for different depths and times, the cumulative curve of the proportion of particles with settling velocities lower than the X-axis value can be constructed (Wilson, 1981).

With the increase in the size of the parti- cles (ﬂocs), there is an increase in the settling velocity. Therefore, in ﬂocculent settling the velocity is not constant as in discrete settling, but tends to increase. Figures 4.11 and 4.12 show the ﬂoc formation process and the increase in the settling velocity in a horizontal ﬂow tank (Figure 4.11) and in a settling column (Figure 4.12). Since the ﬂocculation occurs while the particles go to the bottom, the greater the chance of contact they have, the greater will be the ﬂoc formation. As a result, the removal efﬁciency in ﬂocculent settling is increased with an increase in the depth H and in the time t (differently from discrete settling). Similarly to discrete settling, ﬂocculent settling in an ideal horizontal ﬂow tank can be compared with settling in a column without ﬂow.

This blanket settles as a single mass of particles (the particles tend to remain in a ﬁxed position with relation to the neighbouring particles). A clear separation interface can be observed between the solid phase and the liquid phase, and the level of the interface moves downwards as a result of the sedimentation of the sludge blanket (see Figure 4.13). For the blanket to move downwards, the liquid situated underneath tends to move upwards. In the zone settling, it is the settling velocity of the interface that is used in the design of sedimentation tanks. Zone settling is also called hindered settling.

In a settling column completely homogenised with a high concentration of suspended solids,under quiescent conditions and after a short time, a clear interface Figure 4.13. Zone settling of a solids mass in a settling column is formed. While the interface moves downwards, the supernatant liquid becomes clariﬁed, and a layer with a higher concentration is formed at the bottom. The level of this highly concentrated layer moves upwards due to the continuous increase of the accumulated material at the bottom, which cannot leave the column from its bottom. In a sedimentation tank with continuous withdrawal of the settled sludge from the bottom, the more concentrated layer does not propagate upwards. The reason is that the underﬂow velocity of the sludge (downward, from the bottom) coun- terbalances the expansion velocity (upwards). This situation occurs in tanks with continuous sludge removal from the bottom, such as secondary sedimentation tanks in the activated sludge process (see Figure 4.14). Figure 4.15 presents schematically the behaviour of the layers created in these two distinct conditions (without and with sludge removal from the bottom). 4.5.2 The limiting solids ﬂux theory The solids ﬂux theory describes the zone settling phenomenon that takes place in secondary sedimentation tanks and gravity thickeners. The solids ﬂux theory is a result of the sequential development from many authors, but achieved a greater applicability in the context of wastewater treatment based on the works of Dick (1972). Its utilisation can be for design as well as for operational control. Within a global view of the treatment system, the theory can be used together with a mathematical model of the reactor in order to allow an optimal design of the system (Keinath et al, 1977; Catunda and van Haandel, 1987) or its optimal control (von Sperling, 1990). The following items focus on the behaviour of a secondary sedimentation tank in an activated sludge plant, due to their greater importance when compared with gravity thickeners. However, the general principles are the same in both cases. In this context, ﬂux can be understood as the solids load per unit area (for example expressed as kgSS/m2.h).

In a continuous ﬂow sedimentation tank the solids tend to go to the bottom due to the simultaneous action of two ﬂuxes: • gravity ﬂux (Gg), caused by the gravitational sedimentation of the sludge; • underﬂow ﬂux (Gu), caused by the downward movement originating from the removal of the return sludge from the bottom of the sedimentation tank. The total ﬂux (Gt) moving to the bottom of the sedimentation tank corresponds to the sum of these two components. The mathematical representation of these ﬂuxes can be expressed as (Dick, 1972): Total ﬂux: Gt = Gg + Gu (4.7) Gravity ﬂux: Gg = C.v (4.8) Underﬂow ﬂux: Gu = C.Qu A (4.9)",

The settling velocity v is, on the other hand, a function of the concentration C itself, decreasing with the increase of C. There are various empirical relations to express v in function of C, but the most frequently used is: v = vo.e−K.C (4.10) where: vo = coefﬁcient, expressing the interface settling velocity at a concentration C = 0 (m/h) K = settling coefﬁcient (m3/kg) The ﬂux of solids conveyed to the bottom of the sedimentation tank depends on the concentration C, according to the following conditions: • Low concentration of C. With low values of C, the settling velocity of the interface v is high (Equation 4.10), but the product C.v is low, which results in a low value of the gravity solids ﬂux (Equation 4.8). • Intermediate concentration of C. While C increases, even with the decrease in v, the product C.v increases, that is, the gravity ﬂux increases. • High concentration of C. However, after a certain value of C, the re- duction in the settling velocity v is such that the product C.v starts to decrease. Figure 4.16a presents the curve of the gravity solids ﬂux (Gg = C.v). The intercept of the straight line with slope Qu/A, tangent to the descending reach of the ﬂux curve, with the Y-axis characterises the limiting ﬂux (GL). This can be understood as the maximum ﬂux that can be transported to the bottom of the sedimentation tank with the existing settleability, sludge concentration and underﬂow. The same interpretation can be obtained from Figure 4.16b, in which the total ﬂux (Gt = Gg + Gu) is presented. The result is the same, but in this case, the limiting ﬂux is obtained at the minimum of the total ﬂux curve. This point of minimum indicates that, while the solids concentration increases in the settling tanks from the inlet to the bottom, there will be a concentration (limiting concentration CL) that will bring about the lowest ﬂux (limiting ﬂux GL).

In practical terms, it can be considered that Qr is equal to Qu, since the ex- cess sludge ﬂow (Qu −Qr) is negligible in the mass balance on the secondary sedimentation tank. In broad terms, the applied ﬂux must be equal to or less than the limiting ﬂux (Ga ≤GL), so that the settling tank does not accumulate solids, which could eventually reach a quantity that would lead to their loss in the supernatant of the settling tank, thus deteriorating the ﬁnal efﬂuent quality. On the curve of the gravity ﬂux (Figure 4.16a), the straight line of the applied ﬂux can be drawn. This line starts at the Y-axis (at the value Ga) and goes downwards, in parallel with the line of the limiting ﬂux (slope equal to Qu/A).

The settling tank will be under- loaded when the applied ﬂux is less than the limiting ﬂux. In this condition, only a diluted layer with a low suspended solids concentration (Cd) will be formed. At the bottom of the settling tank a layer with concentration Cu (concentration of the sludge removed) will also develop, due to the support by the tank bottom. • Sedimentation tank with critical load. The settling tank will be critically loaded when the applied ﬂux is equal to the limiting ﬂux. In this case, a thicker sludge layer (concentration CL) will be formed. • Sedimentation tank with thickening overload. The settling tank will be overloaded in terms of thickening of the sludge when the applied ﬂux is greater than the limiting ﬂux. In this condition, the concentration of the thick sludge layer will not go beyond CL and, consequently the thick sludge layer will increase in volume, propagating upwards. Depending on the level reached by the sludge blanket, solids may be discharged with the ﬁnal efﬂuent. • Sedimentation tank with thickening and clariﬁcation overload. The settling tank will be overloaded in terms of thickening and clariﬁcation when, besides having an applied ﬂux greater than the limiting ﬂux, the overﬂow rate (Qi/A) is greater than the sludge settling velocity v. In this case, the diluted layer as well as the thick layer will propagate upwards, with a possible even faster deterioration of the efﬂuent quality. 4.5.3 Determination of the interface settling velocity The settling velocity of the interface, also called zone settling velocity (ZSV) can be determined experimentally through tests in a settling column. For this, the following simpliﬁed methodology is suggested: • homogenise the liquid through mixing in the whole tank (column) volume • interrupt mixing to allow sedimentation • measure the interface level at various time intervals • stop the measurement when the interface is not signiﬁcantly settling any more • plot a graph: interface height (Y axis) × time (X axis) • determine the settling velocity of the interface by the slope of the straight- line reach in the graph (ignore the initial and ﬁnal points that are not on the straight-line reach) The test is commonly done in cylinders up to 0.5 m in height and 10 cm in diameter.

To determine the values of the coefﬁcients vo and K from Equation 4.10, various settling tests should be undertaken for different values of the initial concentration C.

However, frequently, in a wastewater treatment plant, only a simpliﬁed evaluation of the settleability is desired, aiming at using the data for the operational control of the plant. Under these conditions, the Sludge Volume Index (SVI) concept can be adopted. The SVI is deﬁned as the volume occupied by 1 g of sludge after settling for a period of 30 minutes. Hence, instead of determining the interface level at various time intervals, a single measurement at 30 minutes is made. The SVI is calculated through the following equation (see also Figure 4.19): SVI = H30 × 106 H0.SS (4.12) where: SVI = Sludge Volume Index (mL/g) H30 = height of the interface after 30 minutes (m)",

The sample is left to settle without disturbances. • Test without stirring and with a dilution of the sample (DSVI). The original sample is diluted with the ﬁnal efﬂuent of the works in ratios of 2 (e.g. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.). The DSVI is calculated using the diluted sample that leads to an interface height after 30 minutes (H30) of less than 20% of the initial height (andascloseaspossibleto20%,withatoleranceofapproximately4%).The DSVI is calculated from Equation 4.12 and is multiplied by the reciprocal of the dilution ratio (e.g. multiplied by 4 if the dilution ratio was 1/4). • Test with stirring during the settling period (SSVI). The stirring is mild and aims at reproducing the light stirring that occurs in a real scale settling tank. A thin vertical bar with a rotation of 1 or 2 rpm, situated between the centre and the periphery of the cylinder, causes the stirring in the cylinder. • Test with stirring and expression of the results in a standard concentration of 3.5 g/L (3500 mg/L) (SSVI3.5). The advantage is that the results are expressed in a standard concentration (the interpretation of the other SVI tests is subject to the inﬂuence of the initial SS concentration). The concentration of 3.5 g/L is selected, because it represents an usual value of the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration in aeration tanks of the activated sludge process. This test is undertaken for different initial concentrations (obtained through dilutions and concentrations of the sample), and the results are interpolated for a concentration of 3.5 g/L. This test is the most representative and less subject to distortions.",

For Excellent settleability, the range of values for SVI is 0-50, for DSVI is 0-45, for SSVI is 0-50, and for SSVI₃.₅ is 0-40 mL/g. Good settleability corresponds to SVI values of 50-100, DSVI of 45-95, SSVI of 50-80, and SSVI₃.₅ of 40-80 mL/g. Fair settleability is associated with SVI values of 100-200, DSVI of 95-165, SSVI of 80-140, and SSVI₃.₅ of 80-100 mL/g. Poor settleability shows SVI values of 200-300, DSVI of 165-215, SSVI of 140-200, and SSVI₃.₅ of 100-120 mL/g. Finally, Very poor settleability corresponds to SVI values greater than 300, DSVI greater than 215, SSVI greater than 200, and SSVI₃.₅ greater than 120 mL/g. Below the table, the phrase 'Maximum achievable SVI as a function of the SS concentration' is written. The interpretation of the Sludge Volume Index is that, the larger the value, the lower the settleability of the sludge, that is, the sludge occupies a greater value in the secondary sedimentation tank. Besides this, the interpretation is also associ- ated with the type of test. Typical approximate values are expressed in Table 4.4 (von Sperling, 1994; von Sperling and Fr´oes, 1999). It should be emphasised that the traditional SVI test has a limitation because it is dependent on the initial solids concentration (denominator of Equation 4.12). For example, a sludge with a concentration of 1,000 mg/L that does not settle at all at the end of 30 minutes (H30 = H0) will have a SVI of 106/1000 = 1.000 mL/g.

When a liquid is deﬁcient in a gas (oxygen, in this case), there is a natural tendency of the gas to pass from the gas phase, where it is present in sufﬁcient concentrations, to the liquid phase, where it is deﬁcient. Oxygen is a gas that dissolves poorly in the liquid medium. For this reason, in various wastewater treatment systems it is necessary to accelerate the natural pro- cess, in such a way that the oxygen supply may occur at a higher rate, compatible with the biomass utilisation rate. Among the wastewater treatment processes that use artiﬁcial aeration are aerated lagoons, activated sludge and its variants, aerated bioﬁlters and other more speciﬁc processes. In terms of sludge treatment, aerobic digesters also use artiﬁcial aeration. There are two main forms of producing artiﬁcial aeration: • introduce air or oxygen into the liquid (diffused air aeration) • cause a large turbulence, exposing the liquid, in the form of droplets, into the air, and also permitting the entrance of atmospheric air into the liquid medium (surface or mechanical aeration) Within these two types there are variants, which are described in Sections 5.7 and 5.8. Figure 5.1 presents schematically the principles of aeration by diffused air and mechanical aeration. In the end of this chapter, another way of transferring oxygen to the liquid medium is described: gravity aeration (steps, weirs, cascades).",

As soon as the solubility concentration in the liquid phase is reached, both ﬂuxes become equal in magnitude, in such a way that no overall change in the gas concentrations in both phases occurs (Figure 5.2). This dynamic equilibrium is associated with the saturation concentration of the gas in the liquid phase. Figure 5.2. Gas exchanges in (a) a system in equilibrium and (b) a system with a deﬁcit in the dissolved gas In equilibrium conditions, the velocities of absorption (vg) and release (vl) of the gas are equal, that is: vg = vl (5.1) The saturation concentrations in the two phases are proportional to these velocities: kg.Cg = kl.Cs (5.2) where: kg and kl = constants of proportionality Cg = concentration of the gas in the gas phase (mg/L) Cs = concentration of the gas in the liquid phase (mg/L)",

For a water body of unlimited depth, exposed to the gas phase through a surface A, the mass transfer rate dM/dt due to the diffusion of the gas molecules in the liquid phase is deﬁned by Fick’s law (P¨opel, 1979): dM dt = −D.A.∂C ∂x (5.10) where: D = coefﬁcient of molecular diffusion (m2/s) A = surface area (m2)",

In the gas–liquid interface there are two ﬁlms, a gas ﬁlm and a liquid ﬁlm. The gas is absorbed and transported by molecular dif- fusion and mixing (convection) by the gas ﬁlm and subsequently by the liquid ﬁlm. The ﬁlms are considered as stagnant and with a ﬁxed thickness. The two-ﬁlm theory is simpler but provides a good answer in most cases (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991). • Penetration theory. The penetration theory does not assume stagnant ﬁlms, but ﬂuid elements that are momentarily exposed to the gas phase in the liquid interface. During this exposure time the gas diffuses in the ﬂuid elements penetrating the liquid. Differently from the two-ﬁlm theory, the penetration process is described by an unsteady diffusion. The exposure time is considered very short (< 0.1 s) for steady diffusion conditions to prevail. The penetration theory is more soundly theoretically based. According with the penetration theory, the following formulas for the gas trans- fer can be obtained: • Absorption rate of the gas: dM dt = A.(Cs −Co). \b D π.t (5.11) • Penetration depth of the gas: xp = √ π.D.t (5.12) where: M = mass of the gas absorbed through the area A during the time t (g) A = interfacial exposure area (m2) t = exposure time (s) Co = initial concentration of the gas in the bulk of the liquid mass (g/m3) xp = penetration depth of the gas in the liquid mass (m)",

The turbulent ﬂux generated by artiﬁcial aeration consists of a complex sec- ondary movement that surpasses the primary movement of the liquid mass. The turbulence is characterised by oscillations and eddies that transport ﬂuid particles from one layer to another, with variable velocities. The turbulent movement, which is erratic in direction, magnitude and time, can be deﬁned only probabilistically (O’Connor and Dobbins, 1958). As mentioned, gas transfer by turbulent diffusion is much higher than by molec- ulardiffusion.The basic structure of the gas transfer formulation can be maintained, with adaptations only in the sense of simplifying its presentation. The transfer co- efﬁcient incorporates other constants, as shown in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. 5.3 KINETICS OF AERATION The disadvantage of the mentioned formulas is that the diffusion coefﬁcient D, the exposure time to the interfacial area tc and the interfacial area A must be known, in order to allow the estimation of the gas transfer rate. Consequently, it is necessary to adopt a more practical approach, as discussed below. Under steady-state conditions, the diffusion coefﬁcient D and the exposure time tc can be assumed as constants, resulting in a constant gas transfer coefﬁcient (KL). Besides this, the surface area A and the speciﬁc area a (= area/volume = A/V) may also be assumed as constants. Under these conditions, a constant KLa can be deﬁned: KL a = 2.

Designating the oxygen consumption rate by r (g/m3.s) and the maximum value to be reached by C as C∞, the equation of the trajectory of DO in a reactor with oxygen consumption is (see Figure 5.4): C = C∞−(C∞−Co).e−KLa.(t−to) (5.18)",

The experimental determination of the coefﬁcient KLa is discussed in Section 5.9. 5.4 FACTORS OF INFLUENCE IN OXYGEN TRANSFER The oxygen transfer rate of the aeration equipment to be installed in a wastewater treatment plant is frequently determined in different conditions under which it will operate (operating conditions). Therefore, it is important to be able to quantify the factors that inﬂuence the oxygen transfer rate, to allow the estimation of the transfer rate under operating conditions, based on results obtained in tests undertaken under standardised conditions. The factors of major inﬂuence on the oxygen transfer rate are: • temperature • atmospheric pressure (altitude) • dissolved oxygen concentration",

The factors of major inﬂuence on the oxygen transfer rate are: • temperature • atmospheric pressure (altitude) • dissolved oxygen concentration • characteristics of the aerator and the geometry of the reactor a) Temperature The inﬂuence of temperature occurs according to two apparently opposite directions: • Inﬂuence on the saturation concentration Cs. The increase of the temper- ature causes a reduction in the saturation concentration Cs, which implies a reduction in the transfer rate dC/dt. • Inﬂuence on the mass transfer coefﬁcient KLa. The increase in the temper- ature causes an increase in the coefﬁcient KLa, which implies an increase in the transfer rate dC/dt. The inﬂuence on the saturation concentration was discussed in Section 5.2.1. The inﬂuence on KLa can be expressed by: KLa(T) = KLa(20 ◦C).θ(T−20) (5.21) where: KLa(T) = coefﬁcient KLa at any temperature T (s−1) KLa(20) = coefﬁcient KLa at a temperature of 20 ◦C (s−1) θ = temperature coefﬁcient. Usually adopted as 1.024. b) Atmospheric pressure (altitude) The inﬂuence of the altitude is manifested in the oxygen saturation concentration (thegreaterthealtitude,thelowertheatmosphericpressureand,therefore,thelower the saturation concentration). The correction factor for the altitude was discussed in Section 5.2.1. c) Dissolved oxygen concentration Under steady-state conditions, the greater the dissolved oxygen concentration (C) maintained in the reactor, the lower the value of Cs −C, that is, the lower is the oxygen transfer rate (see Equation 5.15). For example, in activated sludge systems, the DO concentration maintained in the reactor is usually in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 mg/L. The correction of the inﬂuence of the DO concentration is obtained by: Correction factor for the DO concentration = Csw −CL Cs(20 ◦C) (5.22) where: Csw = saturation concentration of DO in the liquid in the reactor (mg/L) (see item d below) CL = DO concentration maintained in the liquid in the reactor (mg/L) Cs(20 ◦C) = saturation concentration of DO in clean water at 20 ◦C (mg/L)",

This inﬂuence occurs in two ways: • inﬂuence on the oxygen saturation concentration in the liquid in the reactor (Csw) • inﬂuence on the oxygen transfer coefﬁcient (KLa) Inﬂuence on Csw. The presence of salts, particulate matter and detergents affect the saturation concentration of the liquid in the reactor. This inﬂuence can be quantiﬁed through the following correction factor: β = Csw(wastewater) Cs(clean water) (5.23) The values of β vary from 0.70 to 0.98, but the value of 0.95 is frequently adopted (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991). Inﬂuence on KLa. The oxygen transfer coefﬁcient is inﬂuenced by the charac- teristics of the wastewater as well as the geometry of the reactor and mixing level. The correction factor is: α = KLa (wastewater) KLa (clean water) (5.24) Typical values of α vary from 0.6 to 1.2 for mechanical aeration and from 0.4 to 0.8 for diffused air aeration (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991). 5.5 OXYGEN TRANSFER RATE IN THE FIELD AND UNDER STANDARD CONDITIONS The oxygen transfer rate will vary from place to place, for the same equipment, due to the simultaneous interaction of the various factors covered in Section 5.4. Therefore, it is important that the transfer rate may be expressed under standard conditions, in order to allow a uniform presentation of the values. Therefore, there are the following two ways of expressing the oxygen transfer rate (oxygenation capacity): Standard conditions Operating conditions (ﬁeld) • clean water • wastewater • liquid temperature = 20 ◦C • real temperature of the liquid • altitude = 0 m (sea level) • real altitude of the plant • aeration system installed in a test • aeration system installed in the actual tank reactor",

Incorporating all these factors, the general conversion equation is obtained: OTRstandard = OTRﬁeld β.fH.Cs −CL Cs(20 ◦C) .α.θT−20 (5.25) where: OTRstandard = Standard Oxygen Transfer Rate – SOTR (kgO2/h) OTRﬁeld = Oxygen Transfer Rate in the ﬁeld, under operating conditions (kgO2/h) Cs = oxygen saturation concentration in clean water, at the operating temperature in the ﬁeld (g/m3) CL = average concentration of oxygen maintained in the reactor (g/m3) Cs(20 ◦C) = saturation concentration of oxygen in clean water, under standard conditions (g/m3) fH = correction factor Cs for the altitude (= 1−altitude/9450) (see Equation 5.8) β = see comments for Equation 5.23 α = see comments for Equation 5.24 θ = see comments for Equation 5.21 T = liquid temperature (◦C) The relation between the standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR or OTRstandard) and the oxygen transfer coefﬁcient (KLa) can be obtained through rearrangement of Equation 5.15, in which C = 0 (standard conditions), leading to: OTRstandard = KLa.Cs(20 ◦C).V 1000 (5.26) Due to the various inﬂuencing factors, the OTRﬁeld is lower than the OTRstandard. Thus, in the designs, usually OTRﬁeld is estimated as a function of the oxygen requirements and subsequently the OTRstandard is calculated using Equation 5.25.",

OE = OTRstandard P (5.27) where: OE = oxygenation efﬁciency (kgO2/kWh) P = power consumed (kW) Tables 5.5 and 5.6 (Sections 5.7 and 5.8) present typical values of the oxy- genation efﬁciency (standard conditions) for the most commonly used aeration systems.

Since dry air contains 20.95% of oxygen on a volumetric basis, the molecular weight of oxygen is 32 g/mol and a gas occupies 0.0224 m3/mol, then the concentration of oxygen in the gas is = 0.2095 × 32/0.0224 = 299 gO2/m3. The SOTE can therefore be calculated through (P¨opel, 1979): SOTE = 100.ROU Cg = 100.ROU(g/m3) 299(g/m3) = 0.334.ROU (%) (5.31) where: SOTE = standard oxygen transfer efﬁciency (%) In order to take into consideration the depth of the diffuser di, the ratio of oxygen utilisation can be related to di, leading to the parameter ratio of oxygen utilisation per unit immersion (ROU/di), expressed as gO2/m3.m. Table 5.5 (Section 5.8) presents typical SOTE values (standard conditions) for the more commonly used diffused air aeration systems. 5.6.3 Power level The basic functions of an aeration system in most of the aerated wastewater treat- ment systems are: • oxygenation of the wastewater under treatment • liquid mixing, in order to maintain the biomass in suspension To achieve the second objective, it is necessary to introduce a power per unit volume sufﬁcient to avoid the settlement of the solids. This relation is represented through the concept of the power level (PL or φ), expressed as: PL = P V (5.32) where: PL = power level (W/m3) P = power input (W) V = reactor volume (m3) The greater the power level, the greater the quantity of suspended solids that can remain dispersed in the liquid medium (see Table 5.4). The values presented in the table are only estimates, since the mixing intensity also depends on the number and distribution of aerators (in the case of mechanical aeration) and on the size and geometry of the tank. Owing to the higher suspended solids concentrations in activated sludge reac- tors, the power level to be adopted should usually be higher than 10 W/m3.",

Table 5.5 presents a comparison between the three main types: (a) vertical shaft – low speed, (b) vertical shaft – high speed and (c) horizontal shaft. The power of mechanical aerators usually varies between 5 HP and 100 HP, although, in special conditions, lower and higher values can be found. In mechanical aerators, the submergence of the impellers in relation to the water level is a very important aspect in terms of oxygen transfer and energy consumption. The following situations can occur: • Adequate submergence. The performance is optimal. There is good turbu- lence and absorption of air with relation to the oxygen consumption. • Submergence above the optimal. The unit tends to function more as a mixer than as an aerator. The energy consumption increases without being accompanied by a substantial increase in the oxygen transfer rate. • Submergence below the optimal. Only a surface spray is formed in the vicinity of the aerator, without creating an effective turbulence. The energy consumption and the oxygen transfer rate decrease. The installation of the aerator must follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Be- sides this, local tests should be carried out in order to obtain the optimal submer- gence in the reactor in question. In many activated sludge plants, the oxygen transfer rate can be varied in such a way as to adjust itself to the variations in the oxygen utilisation rate. The variation can be manual or automated, by means of timers or sensors for dissolved oxygen in the reactor. Listed below are some of the most common forms of varying the",

The air is introduced close to the bottom of the tank and the oxygen is transferred to the liquid medium while the bubble rises to the surface. The main diffused air systems can be classiﬁed according to the porosity of the diffuser and the size of the bubble produced: • porous diffuser (ﬁne and medium bubbles): plate, disc, dome, tube (ceramic, plastic, ﬂexible membrane) • non-porous diffuser (coarse bubbles): nozzles or oriﬁces • other systems: jet aerator, aspirating aerator, U-tube aerator Figure 5.6 presents an schematics of the aeration by porous diffusers and aspirat- ing devices. Aspirating devices have an impeller at the lower end (immersed in the liquid), which, when rotating, create a negative pressure, sucking in atmospheric air through a slot situated at the upper end (outside the liquid). Air is diffused into the liquid medium in the form of small bubbles, which are responsible for the oxygenation and mixing of the liquid mass. The aspirating aerators are presented in some texts as mechanical aerators, since they have motors that rotate outside the liquid, and in other texts as diffused air aerators, because they generate air bubbles in the liquid medium.",

The aspirating aerators are presented in some texts as mechanical aerators, since they have motors that rotate outside the liquid, and in other texts as diffused air aerators, because they generate air bubbles in the liquid medium. The diameters of the bubbles considered in the classiﬁcation of the aeration type are (ABNT, 1989): • ﬁne bubble: diameter less than 3 mm • medium bubble: diameter between 3 and 6 mm • coarse bubble: diameter greater than 6 mm In general, the smaller the size of the air bubbles, the greater the surface area available for gas transfer, that is, the greater the oxygenation efﬁciency. For this reason, aeration systems with ﬁne bubbles are the most efﬁcient in the transfer of oxygen. The oxygen transfer efﬁciency of the porous diffusers decreases with the use, due to the internal or external clogging. The internal clogging is due to impurities in the air that are not removed by the ﬁlter. The external clogging is due to bacterial growth on the surface, or the precipitation of inorganic compounds. The oxygen transfer rate can be changed to adjust itself to the oxygen con- sumption through the control of the blowers and the air distribution system, thus allowing energy savings.

Unfortunately, it has not been a common practice the undertaking of aeration tests to verify if the equipment being supplied satisﬁes the required oxygen demand. Even with the tests carried out in the manufacturer’s laboratory, the transformation of the standard condition values to the real situation in the treatment plant is difﬁcult, because of the various inﬂuencing factors, such as the tank shape, number and placing of the aerators and others. In the existing treatment plants it is very important to know the oxygenation capacity of the installed equipment. In the same way that the inﬂuent quality is monitored in order to allow the estimation of oxygen consumption (BOD), it is equally important to have the knowledge of the real capacity of oxygen production available in the reactor under operational conditions. This aspect becomes even more important, considering that there is an optimal operating point that leads to the greatest oxygen transfer efﬁciency (mass of O2 supplied per unit of energy consumed). For instance, in reactors with mechanical aeration, this point is obtained at a certain submergence of the aerators, which can be achieved through the adjustment of the level of the outlet weir (which",

The **jet aerators** mix air with water at high speed, generating bubbles in a mixing chamber, offering lower oxygenation efficiency and simpler maintenance, used in aerated lagoons or activated sludge systems; they have 0.6–1.2 kgO₂/kWh oxygen transfer efficiency and 4–6% oxygenation efficiency. The **spiral flow air diffusers** inject air spirally into activated sludge, forming a circular path of bubbles; no filters are needed, and maintenance is simple, but oxygenation efficiency is relatively low and the system is used in tanks with diffusers at the upper end of the tube.

Considering that the greatest energy costs in a treatment plant are related with aeration, the economy resulting from this procedure can be considerable. The aeration tests in an activated sludge plant can be done according to one of the following methods: • test with clean water • test under operating conditions • steady-state method • steady-state method • unsteady-state method • unsteady-state method The clean water test requires that the tank is emptied and ﬁlled with clean water. The dissolved oxygen (DO) in the medium is removed through the addition of sodium sulphite in the reactor, with the aerators switched off. The aeration capacity is calculated based on the rate of increase in the DO concentration after turning off the aerators. This method is expensive due to the requirement of large volumes of treated water and chemical products, besides being often inpractical in operating plants. The test under operating conditions is accomplished with the reactor in op- erating conditions containing the mixed liquor. The oxygen consumption results from the respiration of the biomass in the mixed liquor. This method is cheaper, since it does not require the addition of external products, and can be done with the treatment plant in operation. Even though the results can be less accurate than those with clean water (if the DO concentration remains low, even with the aerators turned on), the values obtained provide a direct indication of the Oxygen Transfer Rate really available in the system. The steady-state method is that in which all the conditions in the reactor are constant (or practically constant), that is, there are no variations during the test period. Under these conditions, the oxygen consumption is equal to its production. The aeration capacity can be then estimated through the determination of the oxygen utilisation rate by the biomass. The unsteady-state method (reaeration method) consists in turning on the aer- ators, aiming at increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the medium. The Oxygen Transfer Rate is associated with the measured rate of increase in the DO concentration. The references Boon (1980), de Korte and Smits (1985), Stephenson (1985), WPCF & ASCE (1988), ASCE (1990), WEF & ASCE (1992) and von Sperling (1993) present descriptions of the aeration tests. Under operating conditions (more frequent and practical situation), the tests can be carried out in the following simpliﬁed way: Steady-state method: 1. determination of the oxygen consumption rate (r) 2. production rate = consumption rate 3. calculation of the oxygen transfer coefﬁcient KLa: KLa = r (Cs −C)",

Table 5.7 presents a summary of the formulas to be used in the tests under operating conditions. In some of them KLa is explicit, while in others KLa should be obtained by regression analysis with the various values of the pairs DO × t (von Sperling, 1993). Even though regression analysis with the original equation 5.34 is frequently the preferred method to estimate the coefﬁcient KLa, there are some alternative approaches based on the transformation of the basic equation.

    "text_to_embed": "5.10 GRAVITY AERATION In some cases, it may be interesting to increase the DO concentration in the efﬂuent from a wastewater treatment plant, aiming at reaching higher concentrations in the water body, at the efﬂuent-river mixing point. A simple way to achieve this is through the process of gravity aeration, used in some treatment plants. Gravity aeration takes place in weirs or in steps in aeration cascades. Efﬂuents from several wastewater treatment processes may beneﬁt from an increased DO concentration. However, it should be kept in mind that aeration is a gas transfer process: anaerobic efﬂuents submitted to gravity aeration tend to release H2S, which may cause bad odour and corrosion problems. The following text, based on von Sperling (1983b) and P¨opel (1979), describes the principles and application of gravity aeration. The principle of gravity aeration is the use of the potential energy of the water to create gas–liquid interfaces for an efﬁcient gas transfer. When the water passes over the crest of the weir or cascade, two different gas transfer mechanisms may occur: • exposure of the water to the surrounding air • exposure of the air to the water mass",

When the water passes over the crest of the weir or cascade, two different gas transfer mechanisms may occur: • exposure of the water to the surrounding air • exposure of the air to the water mass The ﬁrst mechanism relates to the exposure of the water to the surrounding air, which occurs during the free fall. If the fall height H is known, the average air exposure time [t = (2H/g)0.5] can be estimated, which allows an evaluation of the gas transfer coefﬁcients. The conﬁguration of the water fall crest inﬂuences the aeration, because the subdivision of the ﬂow into several jets increases the air-water contact area, enabling an increased efﬁciency of the gas transfer operation. The second mechanism refers to the exposure of air to the water mass, exactly the reverse of the ﬁrst phenomenon. It occurs due to the submergence of the ﬂow",

    "text_to_embed": "subdivision of the ﬂow into several jets increases the air-water contact area, enabling an increased efﬁciency of the gas transfer operation. The second mechanism refers to the exposure of air to the water mass, exactly the reverse of the ﬁrst phenomenon. It occurs due to the submergence of the ﬂow into the bulk of the liquid located on the base of the waterfall, causing signiﬁcant amounts of air to be absorbed. The incorporated air is then dispersed under the form of bubbles in the liquid, leading to an intense gas transfer. The amount of air ab- sorbed in the second mechanism depends primarily on the velocity [v = (2gH)0.5] of the jet passing through the surface of the downstream water. Consequently, the gas transfer is substantially determined by the height of the fall, in a much more signiﬁcant manner than in the ﬁrst mechanism mentioned. Besides that, the depth of the receiving water inﬂuences the amount of gas transferred: the deeper the jet can submerge into the water mass, the larger the speciﬁc surface area and the longer the contact time between the bubbles and the water. For an optimal utilisation of this effect, the depth should be such that the ﬁnal velocity of the jets prior to reaching the bottom is equal to the upward velocity of the bubbles produced. In general terms, it is understood that the ﬁrst mechanism is efﬁcient for gas release, and the second for gas absorption. Thus, for example, hydrogen sulphide has better release conditions during the free fall phase, while oxygen is mostly absorbed after the submergence of the ﬂow into the downstream water. In summary: • water surrounded by air: predominance of gas release • air surrounded by water: predominance of gas absorption A large part of the oxygen absorption is also caused by the shock of the water jets against obstacles, allowing the subdivision of the falling liquid mass, thus increasing the exposure area. In addition to that, if the water does not fall freely, but attached to the face of the waterfall or steps, the aeration will be signiﬁcantly reduced. The efﬂuent (downstream) oxygen concentration can be estimated based on the coefﬁcient of gas transfer, named efﬁciency coefﬁcient (K) in the case of gravity aeration. Knowing the K value for the water fall at issue, the efﬂuent DO concentration can be estimated for different conditions of saturation and inﬂuent concentrations: Ce = Co + K.(Cs −Co) (5.36) where: Co = inﬂuent (upstream) oxygen concentration (mg/L) Ce = efﬂuent (downstream) oxygen concentration (mg/L) Cs = oxygen saturation concentration (mg/L) K = efﬁciency coefﬁcient (dimensionless) The K coefﬁcient is speciﬁc and constant for each aeration system",
