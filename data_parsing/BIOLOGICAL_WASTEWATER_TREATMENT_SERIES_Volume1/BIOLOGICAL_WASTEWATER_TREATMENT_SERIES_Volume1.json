Water quality is a result of natural phenomena and the acts of human beings. Generally it can be said that water quality is a function of land use in the catchment area. This is due to the following factors: • Natural conditions: even with the catchment area preserved in its natural condition, the surface water quality is affected by run off and inﬁltration resulting from rainfall. The impact of these is dependent on the contact of the water with particles, substances and impurities in the soil. Therefore, the incorporation of suspended solids (e.g. soil particles) or dissolved solids (e.g. ions originating from the dissolution of rocks) occurs even when the catchment area is totally preserved in its natural condition (e.g. occupation of the land with woods and forests). In this case, the soil protection and composition have a great inﬂuence. • Interference of human beings: the interference of man manifests itself either in a concentrated form, such as in the discharge of domestic or industrial wastewater, or in a diffused form, such as in the application of fertilisers or pesticides onto the soil. Both contribute to the introduction of",

Both contribute to the introduction of compounds into the water, thus affecting its quality. Therefore, the form in which human beings use and occupy the land has a direct implication in the water quality. Figure 1.1 presents an example of possible interactions between land use and the presence of factors that modify the water quality in rivers and lakes. Water quality control is associated with a global planning at the whole catchment area level, and not individually, for each impacting source. Separate from the above concept of existing water quality, there is the concept of the desired water quality. The desired quality for a water is a function of its intended use. There are various possible intended uses for a particular water, which are listed in Section 1.2. In summary: • Existing water quality: function of the land use in the catchment area • Desired water quality: function of the intended uses for the water Within the focus of this book, the study of water quality is essential, not only to characterise the consequences of a certain polluting activity, but also to allow the selection of processes and methods that will allow compliance with the desired water uses.",

There is a direct relation between water use and its required quality. In the above list, the most demanding use can be considered domestic water supply, which requires the satisfaction of various quality criteria. Conversely, the less demanding usesaresimpledilutionandtransportationofwastes,whichdonothaveanyspeciﬁc requirements in terms of quality. However, it must be remembered that multiple uses are usually assigned to water bodies, resulting in the necessity of satisfying diverse quality criteria. Such is the case, for example, of reservoirs constructed for water supply, electricity generation, recreation, irrigation and others. Besides the cycle of water on Earth (hydrological cycle), there are internal cycles,inwhichwaterremainsintheliquidstate,buthasitscharacteristicsmodiﬁed as a result of its use. Figure 1.2 shows an example of typical routes of water use, composing partial cycles. In these cycles, the water quality is modiﬁed at each stage of its journey. The management of these internal cycles is an essential role in environmental engineering, and includes the planning, design, construction and control of the works necessary for the maintenance of the desired water quality as a function of its intended uses. Therefore, the engineer or scientist must know how to ask for and interpret the results of water quality samples in the various points of the cycle. This book focuses mainly on the aspect of wastewater treatment, and the impact of the discharge of wastewater to receiving bodies is covered in Chapter 3. 1.3 WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS Table 1.1 presents in a simpliﬁed way the association between the main quality requirements and the corresponding water uses. In cases of water bodies with multiple uses, the water quality must comply with the requirements of the various intended uses. The expression “free” in the table is different from “absolutely free”.

Initially, water is abstracted from the river, lake or water table, and has a certain quality. • Treated water. After abstraction, water undergoes transformations during its treatment to be able to comply with its intended uses (e.g. public or industrial water supply). • Raw wastewater. The water, after being used, undergoes new transformations in its quality and becomes a liquid waste. • Treated wastewater. Aiming at removing its main pollutants, wastewater undergoes treatment before being discharged into the receiving body. Wastewater treatment is responsible for the new modiﬁcation in the quality of the liquid. • Stormwater. Rain water ﬂows on the ground, incorporates some pollutants, and is collected at stormwater systems before being discharged into the receiving body. • Receiving body. Stormwater and the efﬂuent from the wastewater treatment plant reach the receiving body where water quality undergoes new modiﬁcations, as a result of dilution and self-puriﬁcation mechanisms. ",

For Domestic supply, with no specific use listed, the Required quality includes being free from chemical substances harmful to health and organisms harmful to health, having low aggressiveness and hardness, and being aesthetically pleasant, meaning low turbidity, colour, taste and odour, and absence of macro-organisms. Industrial supply differentiates based on Specific use: water incorporated into the product (e.g., food, drinks, medicines) requires being free from chemical substances harmful to health and organisms harmful to health, and being aesthetically pleasant (low turbidity, colour, taste and odour; absence of macro-organisms); water that enters into contact with the product has a Required quality Variable with the product; and water that does not enter into contact with the product (e.g., refrigeration units, boilers) requires Low hardness and Low aggressiveness. For Irrigation, when the Specific use is Horticulture or products ingested raw or with skin, the Required quality is free from chemical substances harmful to health and organisms harmful to health, and Non-excessive salinity; for Other plantations, it requires being free from chemical substances harmful to the soil and plantations, and Non-excessive salinity. Animal water supply, with no specific use listed, requires being free from chemical substances harmful to animals health and organisms harmful to animals health. The Preservation of aquatic life, with no specific use listed, has a Required quality Variable with the environmental requirements of the aquatic species to be preserved. Aquaculture lists two Specific uses: Animal breeding requires being free from chemical substances harmful to animals, workers and consumers health, free from organisms harmful to animals, workers and consumers health, and Availability of nutrients; Vegetable growing requires being free from chemical substances toxic to vegetables and consumers, and Availability of nutrients. Continuing the table, Recreation and leisure specifies Primary contact (direct contact with the liquid medium – bathing; e.g.: swimming, water-skiing, surfing) requires being Free from chemical substances harmful to health and from organisms harmful to health, and having Low levels of suspended solids and oils and grease; Secondary contact (without direct contact with the liquid medium; e.g.: leisure navigation, fishing, contemplative viewing) requires a Pleasant appearance. Energy generation lists Specific uses Hydroelectric power plants, requiring Low aggressiveness, and Nuclear or thermoelectric power plants (e.g. cooling towers), requiring Low hardness. Transport, with no specific use listed, requires Low presence of course material that could be dangerous to vessels. Finally, Waste dilution and transportation, with no specific use or required quality specified, is also included.",

In developing regions, the basic pollution problems still need to be dealt with, and the whole array of pollutants needs to be tackled.

Naturally, each region has its own speciﬁcities, and these need to be taken into account when setting up priorities. Also from the table, it is seen that it is very difﬁcult to generalise industrial wastewater, because of its variability from process to process and from industry to industry. In the table, it is also seen that there are two ways in which the pollutant could reach the receiving body (see Figure 1.3): • point-source pollution • diffuse pollution In point-source pollution, the pollutants reach the water body in points concen- trated in the space. Usually the discharge of domestic and industrial wastewater generates point-source pollution, since the discharges are through outfalls. In diffuse pollution, the pollutants enter the water body distributed at various locations along its length. This is the typical case of storm water drainage, either in rural areas (no pipelines) or in urban areas (storm water collection system, with multiple discharges into the water body). The focus of this book is the control of point-source pollution by means of wastewater treatment.

In this case, in principle, storm water does not contribute to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In other countries, however, a combined (unitary) sew- erage system is adopted, which directs sewage and storm water together into the same system (see Figure 2.1). In this case, the pipelines have a larger diameter, to transport not only the sewage ﬂow, but mainly rainwater, and the design of the WWTP has to take into consideration the corresponding fraction of rainwater that is allowed to enter the treatment works. In countries with a warm climate, during the dry season, sewage ﬂows slowly in these large diameter pipes, leading to long detention times which allow decomposition and generation of malodours. In this book, focus is given to the separate sewerage system, analysing only the three components listed above.

These are of great importance and in many cases the best alternative in various regions, being more applicable in locations with a low population density, like rural areas (even though they are also applied in various densely occupied locations, but frequently presenting problems of inﬁltration in the soil and the resulting contamination of the water table).

More expressive values originating from signiﬁcant point sources must be computed separately and added to the global value. Normally domestic sewage ﬂow is calculated based on the water consumption in the respective locality. The water consumption is usually calculated as a function of the design population and of a value attributed for the average daily per capita water consumption. It is important to observe that for the design and operation of the sewage treat- ment works it is not sufﬁcient to consider only the average ﬂow. It is also necessary to quantify the minimum and maximum ﬂowrates, because of hydraulic and pro- cess reasons. This Section describes the population-forecast studies, the estimates of water consumption and the production of wastewater, together with the variations in ﬂow (minimum and maximum ﬂow). 2.1.2.2 Population forecast The population that contributes to the treatment plant is that situated inside the design area served by the sewerage system. However, the design population is only a certain fraction of the total population in this area, because maybe not all the population is connected to the sewerage system. This ratio (population served/total population) is called the coverage index. This index can be determined (current conditions) or estimated (future conditions), such as to allow the calcu- lation of the design ﬂow. In the ﬁnal years of the planning horizon, it is expected that the coverage will be close to 100%, reﬂecting the improvement and expan- sion in the collection network. The coverage index is a function of the following aspects: • Physical, geographical or topographical conditions of the locality. It is not always possible to serve all households with the sewerage system. Those not served must adopt other solutions besides the off-site water-borne sewerage system. • Adhesion index. This is the ratio between the population actually connected to the system and the population potentially served by the sewerage system in the streets (not all households are connected to the available system, that is to say, not all adhere to the sewerage system). In some communities, it is compulsory to connect to the collection system, in case it passes in front of the house; in other communities, this is optional. • Implementation stages of the sewerage system. In the initial operating years of the WWTP, maybe not all of the designed collection and transport system has been actually installed, and this affects the initial ﬂow.",

    "text_to_embed": "Table 2.1, titled 'Population forecast. Methods based on mathematical formulas,' compares different mathematical methods for forecasting population growth, detailing their characteristics, formulas, and how coefficients are obtained. First, the Linear growth method assumes Population growth follows a constant rate. It is typically Used for short-term forecasts. Curve fitting for this method can also be done through regression analysis. The Curve shape is a straight line, where the Growth rate is described by the formula dP/dt = K_L, indicating a constant rate. The Forecast formula is Pₜ = P₀ + K_L·(t - t₀). If regression analysis is not used, the Coefficient K_L is calculated as (P₂ - P₀) / (t₂ - t₀). Second, the Geometric growth method assumes Population growth is a function of the existing population at every instant. It is also Used for short-term forecasts. Curve fitting can be done through regression analysis. The Curve shape is an exponentially increasing curve. The Growth rate is given by dP/dt = K_G·P. The Forecast formula can be Pₜ = P₀·e^(K_G·(t - t₀)) or Pₜ = P₀·(1 + r)⁽ᵗ⁻ᵗ⁰⁾. If regression analysis is not used, the Coefficients K_G or r are calculated as K_G = (ln P₂ - ln P₀) / (t₂ - t₀) or r = e^(K_G) - 1. Third, Multiplicative regression involves Fitting of population growth by linear regression (using a logarithmic transformation of the equation) or non-linear regression. The Curve shape is also an exponentially increasing curve. No specific formula is given for the Growth rate in the table (indicated by a dash). The Forecast formula shown is Pₜ = P₀ + r·(t - t₀)³. For Coefficients, it states that r and s are obtained through regression analysis. Fourth, the Decreasing growth rate method operates under the Assumption that, as the town grows, the growth rate becomes lower. The population tends asymptotically to the saturation value. The Coefficients can also be estimated by non-linear regression. The Curve shape starts increasing and then levels off towards a saturation value P_S. The Growth rate is defined as dP/dt = K_D·(P_S - P). The Forecast formula is Pₜ = P₀ + (P_S - P₀) × [1 - e^(-K_D·(t - t₀))]. If regression analysis is not used, the Coefficients P_S and K_D are calculated as P_S = (P₁² - P₀·P₂) / (2·P₁ - P₀ - P₂) and K_D = (1 / (t₁ - t₀))·ln[(P_S - P₀) / (P_S - P₁)]. Fifth, the Logistic growth method states that The population growth follows an S-shaped curve. The population tends asymptotically to a saturation value. The coefficients can be also estimated by non-linear regression. Required conditions for using the formulas for coefficients (if regression analysis is not used) are P₀ < P* < P_S and P₀·P₂ < P₁². The point of inflection in the curve occurs at time t = t₀ - (ln C)/K_L and with population P = P_S/2. The Curve shape is an S-shaped curve, starting near 0 and leveling off towards P_S. The Growth rate is given by dP/dt = K_L·P·(P_S - P)/P_S. The Forecast formula is P = P_S / (1 + C·e^(-K_L·t)). If regression analysis is not used, the Coefficients are calculated as P_S = (2·P₀·P₁·P₂ - P₁²·(P₀ + P₂) ) / (P₀·P₂ - P₁²), K_L = (1 / (t₂ - t₁))·ln[(P₁·(P_S - P₀)) / (P₀·(P_S - P₁))], and C = (P_S - P₀)/P₀. The table notes that dP/dt is the population growth rate as a function of time. P₀, P₁, and P₂ represent the population in the years t₀, t₁, and t₂, respectively. P₀ is specifically the population estimated for year t₀, and P_S is the saturation population. The formulas for the decreasing and logistic growth rates require equally-spaced values in time if regression analysis is not employed (referring to inhabitants). K, K_L, K_M, K_D, r, r_L, r_M, r_D, c, c_L, c_M, and c_D are coefficients, and obtaining coefficients by regression analysis is preferable as all of the existing data series can be used, and not only P₀, P₁, and P₂.

Whenever possible it is always best to adopt a regression analysis that allows the incorporation of a largest historical data se- ries instead of two or three 3 points, such as the algebraic methods presented in Table 2.1. The results of the population forecast must be coherent with the population density in the area under analysis. The population density data are also useful in the computation of ﬂows and loads resulting from a certain area or basin within the town. Typical population density values are presented in Table 2.3. Table 2.4 presents typical saturation population densities, in highly occupied metropolitan areas. When making population forecasts, the following points must be taken into consideration: • The population studies are normally very complex. All the variables (unfortunately not always quantiﬁable) that could interact in the spe- ciﬁc locality under study must be analysed. Unexpected events can still occur, which can completely change the predicted trajectory of the population growth. This emphasises the need to establish a realistic value for the planning horizon and for the implementation stages of the WWTP. • The mathematical sophistication associated with the determination of the coefﬁcients of some forecast equations loses its meaning if it is not based on parallel information, often non-quantiﬁable, such as social, economical, geographical and historical aspects. • The common sense of the analyst is very important in the choice of the forecast and in the interpretation of the results. Even though the choice of method is based on the best ﬁt with census data, the extrapolation of the curve requires perception and caution.",

    "text_to_embed": "Table 2.2, titled 'Population forecast based on indirect quantification methods,' describes different indirect approaches for estimating future population. The first Method, Graphical comparison, involves the graphical fitting of the past population under study. The population data of other similar but larger towns are plotted in a manner that the curves coincide at the current value of the population of the town under study. These curves are used as references for the forecast of the town under study. The second Method, Ratio and correlation, assumes that the town population follows the same trend of the region (physical or political region) in which it is inserted. Based on the census records, the ratio 'town population / region population' is calculated and projected for future years. The town population is obtained from the population forecast for the region (made at a planning level by another body) and the calculated ratio. The third Method, Forecast of employment and utility services, is where the population is estimated using a job prediction (made by another body). Based on the past population data and people employed, the 'job/population' ratio is calculated and projected for future years. The town population is calculated from the forecast of the number of jobs in the town. The procedure is similar to the ratio method. The same methodology can be adopted from the forecast of utility services, such as electricity, water, telephone, etc. The service utility companies normally undertake studies of forecast and expansion of their services with relative reliability. A note at the bottom states that The forecast of the ratios can be done based on regression analysis, and the Source for the table is Qasim (1985). Table 2.3, titled 'Typical population densities as a function of land use,' presents typical ranges for population density based on different land use types. For Residential areas, single-family dwellings on large lots have a Population density of 12–36 inhab/ha or 1,200–3,600 inhab/km²; single-family dwellings on small lots have 36–90 inhab/ha or 3,600–9,000 inhab/km²; multiple-family dwellings on small lots have 90–250 inhab/ha or 9,000–25,000 inhab/km²; and Apartments have 250–2,500 inhab/ha or 25,000–250,000 inhab/km². Commercial areas have a typical density of 36–75 inhab/ha or 3,600–7,500 inhab/km². Industrial areas have a density of 12–36 inhab/ha or 1,200–3,600 inhab/km². The Total density (excluding parks and other large-scale equipment) is between 25–125 inhab/ha or 2,500–12,500 inhab/km².

Typical values of per capita water consumption for populations provided with household water connections are presented in Table 2.5. These values can vary from locality to locality.

The data listed in Table 2.5 are simply typical average values, being naturally subjected to all the variability resulting from the factors listed in Table 2.6. Table 2.5, titled Typical ranges of per capita water consumption, provides typical values for how much water is used per person per day, based on the size of the community. The table lists different Community size categories, their corresponding Population range in inhabitants, and the typical Per capita water consumption in Liters per inhabitant per day (L/inhab.d). For a Rural settlement, the Population range is less than 5,000 inhabitants, with typical per capita consumption between 90 and 140 L/inhab.d. A Village has a Population range of 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants, with consumption between 100 and 160 L/inhab.d.

The first Influencing factor is Water availability; the Comment explains that In locations of water shortage consumption tends to be less. Climate is another factor; Warmer climates induce a greater water consumption. Community size also plays a role; Larger cities generally present a larger per capita water consumption to account for strong commercial and institutional activities. The Economic level of the community is influential; A higher economic level is associated with a higher water consumption. The Level of industrialisation means that Industrialised locations present a higher consumption. Metering of household consumption is listed as a factor, and the Comment notes that Metering inhibits greater consumption. Water cost is also influential; A higher cost reduces consumption. Water pressure is a factor because High pressure in the distribution system induces greater use and wastage. Finally, System losses influence consumption; Losses in the water distribution network imply the necessity of a greater water production. Table 2.5, titled Typical ranges of per capita water consumption, provides typical values for how much water is used per person per day, based on the size of the community.

The State of Minas Gerais has many features in common with Brazil, as a whole, and many other developing countries, because it presents regions with high and low eco- nomic level, rainfall and temperature. The range of variation in the data was: per capita water consumption: 84 to 248 l/inhab.d; urban population: 4,000–2,300,000 inhabitants; average per capita income: US$8–1600 per inhabitant per year; mean yearly temperature: 20–26◦C; mean yearly rainfall: 300–1750 mm/year. Figure 2.3 presents the relation of the per capita water consumption with per capita income, which was the clearer one. The analysis should be done only in terms of trends and average values, since the correlation coefﬁcient was not high, as a result of a substantial scatter in the data. Figure 2.4 presents the ranges of variation of the per capita water consumption as a function of the category of the per capita income and rainfall of the 45 municipal- ities (separation between low and high income: US$110/inhab.year, corresponding to the median of values; separation of high and low rainfall: 1350 mm/year, cor- responding to the average value of the State of Minas Gerais). Naturally these values are region speciﬁc, but it is believed that a certain extrapolation of trends and ranges can be done, but always judiciously.

It is important to notice that the water ﬂow to be considered is the ﬂow actually consumed, and not the ﬂow produced by the water treatment works. The water ﬂow produced is higher than that consumed due to unaccounted water losses in the distribution system, which can vary typically from 20 to 50%. Thus in a locality where the loss is 30%, for each 100 m3 of water produced, 30 m3 are unaccounted for and only 70 m3 are consumed. Of this 70 m3, around 80% (56 m3/d) return in the form of sewage to the sewerage system. 2.1.2.5 Flow variations. Maximum and minimum ﬂows Water consumption and wastewater generation in a locality vary throughout the day (hourly variations), during the week (daily variations) and throughout the year (seasonal variations). Figure 2.5 presents typical hourly inﬂuent ﬂowrate variations in a WWTP. Two main peaks can be observed: a peak at the beginning of the morning (more pronounced) and a peak at the beginning of the evening (more distributed).

The table lists the formulas, the Author, and the Reference source. According to the Author Harmon, referenced in Qasim (1985), the formula for Qmax/Qav is 1 + (14 / (4 + P⁰.⁵)). The table does not provide a formula for Qmin/Qav by Harmon (indicated by a dash). According to the Author Gifft, referenced in Fair et al (1973), the formula for Qmax/Qav is 5P⁻⁰.¹⁶. The formula for Qmin/Qav by Gifft is 0.2P⁰.¹⁶. The Notes section provides important information: P = population, expressed in thousands. Gifft's formula is indicated for P < 200, which means it is applicable for populations less than 200,000 inhabitants.K2 = 1.5 (peak coefﬁcient for the hour with the highest water consumption) • K3 = 0.5 (reduction coefﬁcient for the hour with the lowest water consumption) Thus, the maximum and minimum water ﬂows can be given by the formulas: Qmax = Qav . K1 . K2 = 1.8 Qav (2.4) Qmin = Qav . K3 = 0.5 Qav (2.5) If it is possible to carry out ﬂow measurements, to establish the real ﬂow vari- ations, the actual data should be used in the design. The coefﬁcients K1, K2 and K3 are generalised, thus probably not allowing the accurate reproduction of the ﬂow variations in the locality under analysis. Over- or underestimated values affect directly the technical and economical performance of the sewage works design. When considering hourly variations of wastewater ﬂow, it should be taken into consideration that the ﬂuctuations are absorbed and reduced in amplitude along the sewerage system. It is easy to understand that the larger the network (or the population), the lower are the chances of peak ﬂows to overlap simultaneously in the works entrance. Thus the residence time in the sewerage system has a large inﬂuence on the absorption of the peak ﬂows. Based on this concept, some authors have developed formulas for correlating the coefﬁcients of variation with population, or with average ﬂow (Table 2.10). As an illustration, the following table presents the calculated coefﬁcients for different populations. This table presents coefficients of hourly variation of sewage flow (ratios of maximum or minimum flow to average flow, Qmax/Qav and Qmin/Qav) for different Population sizes, based on formulas by Harmon and Gifft. For a Population of 1,000, the Qmax/Qav according to Harmon is 3.8 and according to Gifft is 5.0, while the Qmin/Qav according to Gifft is 0.20. For a Population of 10,000, Harmon's Qmax/Qav is 3.0, Gifft's Qmax/Qav is 3.4, and Gifft's Qmin/Qav is 0.14. For a Population of 100,000, Harmon's Qmax/Qav is 2.0, Gifft's Qmax/Qav is 2.3, and Gifft's Qmin/Qav is 0.09. Finally, for a Population of 1,000,000, Harmon's Qmax/Qav is 1.4, but data is not available for Gifft's formulas (indicated by dashes). It can be observed that even the product of the coefﬁcients K1 and K2 utilised for water supply, and frequently adopted as 1.8, could induce an underestimated ratio Qmax/Qav for a wide population range.",

The quantity of inﬁltrated water depends on various factors, such as the extension of the collection network, pipeline diameters, drainage area, soil type, water table depth, topography and population density (number of connections per unit area) (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991). When no speciﬁc local data are available, inﬁltration rate is normally expressed in terms of ﬂow per extension of the sewerage system or per area served. The values presented in Table 2.11 can be used as a ﬁrst estimate, when no speciﬁc local data are available (Crespo, 1997). Metcalf & Eddy (1991) present the inﬁltration coefﬁcient as a function of the pipe diameter: 0.01 to 1.0 m3/d.km per mm. For instance, for a pipe diameter of 200 mm, the inﬁltration rate will range between 2 to 200 m3/d.km. The length of the network may be measured in the locality by using the map of the location of the sewerage system. In the absence of these data (for instance, for future populations), in preliminary studies of smaller localities, where the population density is usually less, values around 2.5 to 3.5 m of network per inhabitant may be adopted. In medium-size cities this value could be reduced to around 2.0 to 3.0 m/inhab and in densely populated regions, even smaller values may be reached (1.0 to 2.0 m/inhab or even lower). Figure 2.6, based on the 45 municipalities described in Section 2.1.2, presents the ranges of variation of per capita length of sewerage network for two population categories. Based on the inﬁltration values per unit length and the per capita sewerage net- work length, per capita inﬁltration values may be estimated to range between 8 to 150 L/inhab.d, excluding the extreme values. In areal terms, based on typical pop- ulation densities (25 to 125 inhab/ha), inﬁltration rates between 0.2 and 20 m3/d per ha of drainage area (20 to 2000 m3/d.km2) are obtained. These ranges",

For minimum ﬂow conditions, inﬁltration can be excluded, as a safety measure (in the case of minimum ﬂow, the safety in a design is in the direction of establishing the lowest ﬂow). 2.1.4 Industrial wastewater ﬂow Industrial wastewater ﬂow is a function of the type and size of the industry, man- ufacturing process, level of recycling, existence of pre-treatment, etc. Even in the case of two industries that manufacture essentially the same product, the wastew- ater ﬂows can diverge substantially. If there are large industries contributing to the public sewerage system and subsequently to a WWTP, the adequate evaluation of their respective ﬂows is of great importance. Industrial wastewater has a great inﬂuence in the planning and operation of a WWTP. Speciﬁc data must be obtained for each signiﬁcant industry, through industrial surveys, thus allowing the supply of data of interest for the project. With relation to the water consumption and the generation of wastewater, the following information at least must be obtained for the main industries: • Water consumption • Total volume consumed (per day or month) • Volume consumed in the various stages of the process",

The table presented only gives a starting point for more superﬁcial or general studies. The daily discharge pattern for industrial wastewater does not follow the do- mestic ﬂow variations, changing substantially from industry to industry. Industrial ﬂow peaks do not necessarily coincide with the domestic peaks, that is to say, the total maximum ﬂow (domestic + industrial) is normally less than the simple sum of the maximum ﬂows. 2.2 WASTEWATER COMPOSITION 2.2.1 Quality parameters Domestic sewage contains approximately 99.9% water. The remaining part in- cludes organic and inorganic, suspended and dissolved solids, together with mi- croorganisms. It is because of this 0.1% that water pollution takes place and the wastewater needs to be treated. The composition of the wastewater is a function of the uses to which the water was submitted. These uses, and the form with which they were exercised, vary with climate, social and economic situation and population habits.

Under TOTAL SOLIDS, which are Organic and inorganic; suspended and dissolved; settleable, several sub-parameters are described. Suspended solids are Part of organic and inorganic solids that are non-filterable. Fixed suspended solids are Mineral compounds, not oxidisable by heat, inert, which are part of the suspended solids. Volatile suspended solids are Organic compounds, oxidisable by heat, which are part of the suspended solids. Dissolved solids are Part of organic and inorganic solids that are filterable, Normally considered having a dimension less than 10⁻³ µm. Fixed dissolved solids are Mineral compounds of the dissolved solids. Volatile dissolved solids are Organic compounds of the dissolved solids. Settleable solids are Part of organic and inorganic solids that settle in 1 hour in an Imhoff cone, providing an Approximate indication of the settling in a sedimentation tank. Moving to ORGANIC MATTER, this is a Heterogeneous mixture of various organic compounds, with Main components being proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. Methods for its Indirect determination include BOD₅, which is Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Measured at 5 days and 20 °C, Associated with the biodegradable fraction of carbonaceous organic compounds, and Represents the Measure of the oxygen consumed after 5 days by the microorganisms in the biochemical stabilisation of the organic matter. COD is Chemical Oxygen Demand, which Represents the quantity of oxygen required to chemically stabilise the carbonaceous organic matter, and Uses strong oxidising agents under acidic conditions. Ultimate BOD is the Ultimate Biochemical Oxygen Demand, which Represents the total oxygen consumed at the end of several days, by the microorganisms in the biochemical stabilisation of the organic matter. Direct determination methods include TOC, which is Total Organic Carbon, a Direct measure of the carbonaceous organic matter Determined through the conversion of organic carbon into carbon dioxide.TOTAL NITROGEN includes organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. It is an essential nutrient for microorganisms' growth in biological wastewater treatment. Organic nitrogen and Ammonia together are called Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), representing Nitrogen in the form of proteins, aminoacids and urea. Organic nitrogen is Produced in the first stage of the decomposition of organic nitrogen. Nitrite is an Intermediate stage in the oxidation of ammonia and is Practically absent in raw sewage. Nitrate is the Final product in the oxidation of ammonia and is Practically absent in raw sewage.TOTAL PHOSPHORUS exists in organic and inorganic forms and is an essential nutrient in biological wastewater treatment. Organic phosphorus is Combined with organic matter. Inorganic phosphorus includes Orthophosphates and polyphosphates. Other parameters include pH, an Indicator of the acidic or alkaline conditions of the wastewater. A solution is neutral at pH 7, and Biological oxidation processes normally tend to reduce the pH. ALKALINITY is an Indicator of the buffer capacity of the medium (resistance to variations in pH), Caused by the presence of bicarbonate, carbonate and hydroxyl ions. CHLORIDES are Originating from drinking water and human and industrial wastes. Finally, OILS AND GREASE are a Fraction of organic matter which is soluble in hexane, and In domestic sewage, the sources are oils and fats used in food.

Algae are Autotrophic photosynthetic organisms, containing chlorophyll, Important in the production of oxygen in water bodies and in some sewage treatment processes, and In lakes and reservoirs they can proliferate in excess, deteriorating the water quality. Fungi are Predominantly aerobic, multicellular, non-photosynthetic, heterotrophic organisms, Also of importance in the decomposition of organic matter, and Can grow under low pH conditions. Protozoa are Usually unicellular organisms without cell wall, the Majority is aerobic or facultative, They Feed themselves on bacteria, algae and other microorganisms, are Essential in biological treatment to maintain an equilibrium between the various groups, and Some are pathogenic. Viruses are Parasitic organisms, formed by the association of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and a protein structure, they are Pathogenic and frequently difficult to remove in water or wastewater treatment. Helminths are Higher-order animals, and Helminth eggs present in sewage can cause illnesses.

In wastewater treatment, the solids can be classiﬁed according to (a) their size and state, (b) their chemical characteristics and (c) their settleability: Solids in sewage • Classiﬁcation by size and state • Suspended solids (non-ﬁlterable) • Dissolved solids (ﬁlterable) • Classiﬁcation by chemical characteristics • Volatile solids (organic) • Fixed solids (inorganic) • Classiﬁcation by settleability • Settleable suspended solids • Non-settleable suspended solids a) Classiﬁcation by size The division of solids by size is above all a practical division. For convention it can be said that particles of smaller dimensions capable of passing through a ﬁlter paper of a speciﬁc size correspond to the dissolved solids, while those with larger dimensions and retained by the ﬁlter are considered suspended solids. To be more precise, the terms ﬁlterable (=dissolved) solids and non-ﬁlterable (=suspended) solids are more adequate. In an intermediate range there are the colloidal solids, whichareofimportanceinwatertreatment,butaredifﬁculttoidentifybythesimple method of paper ﬁltration.

As a re- sult, direct or indirect methods can be adopted for the quantiﬁcation of organic matter: • Indirect methods: measurement of oxygen consumption • Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) • Ultimate Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BODu) • Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) • Direct methods: measurement of organic carbon • Total Organic Carbon (TOC) a) Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) The main ecological effect of organic pollution in a water body is the decrease in the level of dissolved oxygen. Similarly, in sewage treatment using aerobic processes, the adequate supply of oxygen is essential, so that the metabolic processes of the microorganisms can lead to the stabilisation of the organic matter. The basic idea is then to infer the “strength” of the pollution potential of a wastewater by the measurement of the oxygen consumption that it would cause, that is, an indirect quantiﬁcationofthepotentialtogenerateanimpact,andnotthedirectmeasurement of the impact in itself. This quantiﬁcation could be obtained through stoichiometric calculations based on the reactions of oxidation of the organic matter. If the substrate was, for example, glucose (C6H12O6), the quantity of oxygen required to oxidise the given quantity of glucose could be calculated through the basic equation of respiration. This is the principle of the so-called Theoretical Oxygen Demand (TOD). In practice, however, a large obstacle is present: the sewage has a great hetero- geneity in its composition, and to try to establish all its constituents in order to calculate the oxygen demand based on the chemical oxidation reactions of each of them is totally impractical. Besides, to extrapolate the data to other conditions would not be possible. The solution found was to measure in the laboratory the consumption of oxygen exerted by a standard volume of sewage or other liquid, in a pre- determined time. It was thus introduced the important concept of Biochemi- cal Oxygen Demand (BOD). The BOD represents the quantity of oxygen re- quired to stabilise, through biochemical processes, the carbonaceous organic matter. It is an indirect indication, therefore, of the biodegradable organic carbon. Complete stabilisation takes, in practical terms, various days (around 20 days or more for domestic sewage). This corresponds to the Ultimate Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BODu). However, to shorten the time for the laboratory test, and to allow a",

The difference in the DO level on the day zero and day 5 represents the oxygen consumed for the oxidation of the organic matter, being therefore, the BOD5. Thus, for example, a sample from a water body presented the following results (see Figure 2.10): DO on day 0: 7 mg/L DO on day 5: 3 mg/L BOD5 = 7 −3 = 4 mg/L.For sewage, some practical aspects require some adaptations. Sewage, having a large concentration of organic matter, consumes quickly (well before the ﬁve days) all the dissolved oxygen in the liquid medium. Thus, it is necessary to make dilutions in order to decrease the concentration of the organic matter, such that the oxygen consumption at 5 days is numerically less than the oxygen available in the sample (the sample is lost if, at day 5, the DO concentration is zero, because it will not be possible to know when the zero concentration was reached). Also it is usually necessary to introduce a seed, containing microorganisms, to allow a fasterstartofthedecompositionprocess.Tomeasureonlythecarbonaceousoxygen demand, an inhibitor for nitriﬁcation (nitrogenous oxygen demand, associated with the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) can be added. Domestic sewage has a BOD in the region of 300 mg/L, or that is to say, 1 litre of sewage is associated with the consumption of approximately 300 mg of oxygen, in ﬁve days, in the process of the stabilisation of the carbonaceous organic matter. The main advantages of the BOD test are related to the fact that the test allows: • an approximate indication of the biodegradable fraction of the wastewater; • an indication of the degradation rate of the wastewater;",

However, the following limitations may be mentioned (Marais & Ekama, 1976): • low levels of BOD5 can be found in the case that the microorganisms responsible for the decomposition are not adapted to the waste; • heavy metals and other toxic substances can kill or inhibit the microorgan- isms; • the inhibition of the organisms responsible for the oxidation of ammo- nia is necessary, to avoid the interference of the oxygen consumption for nitriﬁcation (nitrogenous demand) with the carbonaceous demand; • the ratio of BODu/BOD5 varies with the wastewater; • the ratio of BODu/BOD5 varies, for the same wastewater, along the WWTP treatment line; • the test takes ﬁve days, being not useful for operational control of a WWTP. Despite of the limitations above, the BOD test continues to be extensively used, partly for historical reasons and partly because of the following points: • the design criteria for many wastewater treatment processes are frequently expressed in terms of BOD; • the legislation for efﬂuent discharge in many countries, and the evaluation of the compliance with the discharge standards, is normally based on BOD. Substantial research has been directed towards the substitution of BOD by other parameters. In the area of instrumentation, there are respirometric equipments that make automated measurements of the oxygen consumption, allowing a reduction in the period required for the test. However, universality has not yet been reached regarding the parameter or the methodology. It is observed that the COD test is being more and more used for design, math- ematical modelling and performance evaluation. However, the sanitary engineer must be familiar with the interpretation of the BOD and COD tests and know how to work with the complementary information that they both supply. The present text utilises BOD in items in which the more consolidated inter- national literature is based on BOD, and it uses COD in the items, usually more recent, in which the literature is based more on COD. In this way, it is easier to compare the design parameters presented in this book with international literature parameters. b) Ultimate Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BODu) The BOD5 corresponds to the oxygen consumption exerted during the ﬁrst 5 days.",

For High concentration sewage, the BODᵤ/BOD₅ ratio typically ranges from 1.1 to 1.5. For Low concentration sewage, the range is 1.2 to 1.6. Primary effluent also has a typical range of 1.2 to 1.6. Secondary effluent shows a higher range, typically between 1.5 and 3.0. The Source states that these values were Calculated using the coefficients presented by Fair et al (1973) and Arceivala (1981). After this, the oxygen consumption can be considered negligible. In this way the Ultimate Biochemical Oxygen Demand corresponds to the oxygen consumption until this time, after what there is no signiﬁcant consumption, meaning that the organic matter has been practically all stabilised. Figure 2.11 shows the progression of BOD in time, in a sample analysed along various days. For domestic sewage, it is considered, in practical terms, that after 20 days of the test the stabilisation is practically complete. Therefore the BODu can be determined at 20 days. The concept of the test is similar to the standard BOD of 5 days, varying only with the ﬁnal period of determination of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Table 2.16 presents typical ranges of the conversion factor for BOD5 to BODu (domestic waste). Such a conversion is important, because various sewage treat- ment processes are designed using a BODu base. Chapter 3 shows how to proceed with this conversion using a speciﬁc formula. Various authors adopt the ratio BODu/BOD5 equal to 1.46. This means that, in the case of having a BOD5 of 300 mg/L, the BODu is assumed to be equal to 1.46 × 300 = 438 mg/L.",

    "text_to_embed": "c) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) The COD test measures the consumption of oxygen occurring as a result of the chemical oxidation of the organic matter. The value obtained is, therefore, an indirect indication of the level of organic matter present. The main difference with the BOD test is clearly found in the nomenclature of both tests. The BOD relates itself with the biochemical oxidation of the or- ganic matter, undertaken entirely by microorganisms. The COD corresponds to the chemical oxidation of the organic matter, obtained through a strong oxidant (potassium dichromate) in an acid medium. The main advantages of the COD test are: • the test takes only two to three hours; • because of the quick response, the test can be used for operational control; • the test results give an indication of the oxygen required for the stabilisation of the organic matter; • the test allows establishment of stoichiometric relationships with oxygen; • the test is not affected by nitriﬁcation, giving an indication of the oxidation of the carbonaceous organic matter only (and not of the nitrogenous oxygen demand). The main limitations of the COD test are: • in the COD test, both the biodegradable and the inert fractions of organic matter are oxidised. Therefore, the test may overestimate the oxygen to be consumed in the biological treatment of the wastewater; • the test does not supply information about the consumption rate of the organic matter along the time; • certain reduced inorganic constituents could be oxidised and interfere with the result. For raw domestic sewage, the ratio COD/BOD5 varies between 1.7 and 2.4. For industrial wastewater, however, this ratio can vary widely. Depending on the value of the ratio, conclusions can be drawn about the biodegradability of the wastewater and the treatment process to be employed (Braile & Cavalcanti, 1979): • Low COD/BOD5 ratio (less than 2.5 or 3.0): • the biodegradable fraction is high • good indication for biological treatment • Intermediate COD/BOD5 ratio (between 2.5 and 4.0): • the inert (non-biodegradable) fraction is not high • treatability studies to verify feasibility of biological treatment • High COD/BOD5 ratio (greater than 3.5 or 4.0): • the inert (non-biodegradable) fraction is high • possible indication for physical–chemical treatment",

The COD/BOD5 ratio also varies as the wastewater passes along the various units of the treatment works. The tendency is for the ratio to increase, owing to the stepwise reduction of the biodegradable fraction, at the same time that the inert fraction remains approximately unchanged. In this way, the ﬁnal efﬂu- ent of the biological treatment has values of the COD/BOD5 ratio usually higher than 3.0. d) Total Organic Carbon (TOC) In this test the organic carbon is directly measured, in an instrumental test, and not indirectly through the determination of the oxygen consumed, like the three tests above. The TOC test measures all the carbon released in the form of CO2. To guarantee that the carbon being measured is really organic carbon, the inorganic forms of carbon (like CO2, HCO− 3 etc) must be removed before the analysis or be corrected when calculated (Eckenfelder, 1980). The TOC test has been mostly used so far in research or in detailed evaluations of the characteristics of the liquid, due to the high costs of the equipment. e) Relationship between the representative parameters of oxygen consumption In samples of raw and treated domestic sewage, the usual ratios between the main representative parameters of oxygen consumption (BODu/BOD5 and COD/BOD5) are shown in Figure 2.12. The following comments can be made: • The ratios can never be lower than 1.0. • The ratios increase, from the condition of untreated to biologically treated wastewater. • The higher the treatment efﬁciency, the higher the value of the ratio. Table 2.18, titled Predominant forms of nitrogen in the water,lists different forms of nitrogen commonly found in water along with their chemical Formula and Oxidation state. Molecular nitrogen has the Formula N₂ and an Oxidation state of 0. Organic nitrogen has a Variable Formula and a Variable Oxidation state. Free ammonia has the Formula NH₃ and an Oxidation state of -3. The Ammonium ion has the Formula NH₄⁺ and an Oxidation state of -3. The Nitrite ion has the Formula NO₂⁻ and an Oxidation state of +3.

In the aquatic medium, nitrogen can be found in the forms presented in Table 2.18. Nitrogen is a component of great importance in terms of generation and control of the water pollution, principally for the following aspects: • Water pollution • nitrogen is an essential nutrient for algae leading, under certain condi- tions, to the phenomenon of eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs; • nitrogen can lead to dissolved oxygen consumption in the receiving water body due to the processes of the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and this nitrite to nitrate; • nitrogen in the form of free ammonia is directly toxic to ﬁsh; • nitrogen in the form of nitrate is associated with illnesses such as methaemoglobinaemia • Sewage treatment • nitrogen is an essential nutrient for the microorganisms responsible for sewage treatment; • nitrogen, in the processes of the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate (nitriﬁcation), which can occur in a WWTP, leads to oxygen and alkalinity consumption; • nitrogen in the process of the conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas (denitriﬁcation), which can take place in a WWTP, leads to (a) the economy of oxygen and alkalinity (when occurring in a controlled form) or (b) the deterioration in the settleability of the sludge (when not controlled). The determination of the prevailing form of nitrogen in a water body can pro- vide indications about the stage of pollution caused by an upstream discharge of sewage. If the pollution is recent, nitrogen is basically in the form of organic nitrogen or ammonia and, if not recent, in the form of nitrate (nitrite concentra- tions are normally low). In summary, the distinct forms can be seen in a gener- alised form presented in Table 2.19 (omitting other sources of nitrogen apart from sewage).",

For Raw wastewater, the Prevailing form of nitrogen is Organic nitrogen and Ammonia. In cases of Recent pollution in a water course, the predominant forms are also Organic nitrogen and Ammonia. During the Intermediate stage in the pollution of a water course, Organic nitrogen, Ammonia, Nitrite (in lower concentrations), and Nitrate are all present. In the case of Remote pollution in a water course, Nitrate is the prevailing form of nitrogen. Effluent from a treatment process without nitrification primarily contains Ammonia. Effluent from a treatment process with nitrification predominantly contains Nitrate. Finally, Effluent from a treatment process with nitrification/denitrification is characterized by Low concentrations of all forms of nitrogen. A note at the bottom clarifies that organic nitrogen + ammonia = TKN (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen). if not recent, in the form of nitrate (nitrite concentra- tions are normally low). In summary, the distinct forms can be seen in a gener- alised form presented in Table 2.19 (omitting other sources of nitrogen apart from sewage). In raw domestic sewage, the predominant forms are organic nitrogen and am- monia. Organic nitrogen corresponds to amina groups. Ammonia is mainly derived from urea, which is rapidly hydrolysed and rarely found in raw sewage. These two, together, are determined in the laboratory by the Kjeldahl method, leading to the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). Most of the TKN in domestic sewage has physio- logical origin. The other forms of nitrogen are usually of lesser importance in the inﬂuent to a WWTP. In summary: • TKN= ammonia +organic nitrogen (prevailingformindomesticsewage) • TN = TKN + NO2−+ NO3− (total nitrogen) The distribution of ammonia in the raw sewage can be represented schematically as shown in Figure 2.13. It is seen that the fraction of the oxidised nitrogen NOx (nitrite + nitrate) is negligible in raw sewage. TKN can be further subdivided in a soluble fraction (dominated by ammonia) and a particulate fraction (associated with the organic suspended solids −nitrogen participates in the constitution of practically all forms of particulate organic matter in sewage). Ammonia exists in solution in the form of the ion (NH4+) and in a free form, not ionised (NH3), according to the following dynamic equilibrium: NH3 + H+ ↔NH4+ free ammonia ionised ammonia (2.6)",

Distribution between the forms of ammonia • pH < 8 Practically all the ammonia is in the form of NH4+ • pH = 9.5 Approximately 50% NH3 and 50% NH4+ • pH > 11 Practically all the ammonia in the form of NH3 In this way it can be seen that, in the usual range of pH, near neutrality, the am- monia present is practically in the ionised form. This has important environmental consequences, because free ammonia is toxic to ﬁsh even in low concentrations. The temperature of the liquid also inﬂuences this distribution. At a temperature of 25 ◦C, the proportion of free ammonia relative to the total ammonia is approxi- mately the double compared with a temperature of 15 ◦C. The following equation allows the calculation of the proportion of free ammonia within total ammonia as a function of temperature and pH (Emerson et al, 1975): Free NH3 Total ammonia(%) = 1 + 100.09018+[2729.92/(T+273.20)]−PH −1 × 100 (2.6) where: T = liquid temperature (◦C) Application of Equation 2.6 leads to the values of the ammonia distribution presented in Table 2.20 and illustrated in Figure 2.14.

Mathematical models for wastewater treatment processes usually consider that both forms of phosphate are represented by orthophosphates since after hydrolysis they will effectively be present as such. Phosphorus in de- tergents can account for up to 50% of the total phosphorus present in domestic sewage. Another way of fractionating phosphorus in wastewater is with respect to its form as solids (IAWQ, 1995): • soluble phosphorus (predominantly inorganic) – mainly polyphosphates and orthophosphates (inorganic phosphorus), together with a small fraction corresponding to the phosphorus bound to the soluble organic matter in the wastewater • particulate phosphorus (all organic) – bound to particulate organic matter in the wastewater Figure 2.15 illustrates the fractionation of phosphorus in untreated domestic sewage. The importance of phosphorus is associated with the following aspects: • Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for the growth of the microorganisms responsible for the stabilisation of organic matter. Usually domestic sewage has sufﬁcient levels of phosphorus, but a lack may occur in some industrial wastewaters; • Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for the growth of algae, eventually lead- ing, under certain conditions, to the eutroﬁcation of lakes and reservoirs.",

Most of these organisms play various essential roles, mainly related to the transformation of the constituents in the biogeochemical cycles. Biological wastewater treatment relies on these organisms, and this aspect is covered in many parts of this book. Another important aspect in terms of the biological quality of a water or wastew- ater is that related to the disease transmission by pathogenic organisms. The major groups of pathogenic organisms are: (a) bacteria, (b) viruses, (c) protozoans and (d) helminths. Water-related disease is deﬁned as any signiﬁcant or widespread adverse effects on human health, such as death, disability, illness or disorders, caused directly or indirectly by the condition, or changes in the quantity or quality of any water (Grabow, 2002). A useful way of classifying the water-related dis- eases is to group them according to the mechanism by which they are transmitted (water borne, water hygiene, water based, water related). Table 2.21 presents the main four categories, with a summary description and the main preventive strate- gies to be employed. Table 2.22 details the faecal–oral transmission diseases (water borne and water hygiene), with the main pathogenic agents and symptoms. Faecal–oral diseases are of special interest for the objectives and theme of this book, since they are associated with proper excreta and wastewater treatment and disposal. The number of pathogens present in the sewage of a certain community varies substantially and depends on: (a) socio-economic status of the population; (b) health requirements; (c) geographic region; (d) presence of agroindustries; (e) type of treatment to which the sewage was submitted. b) Indicator organisms The detection of pathogenic organisms, mainly bacteria, protozoans and viruses, in a sample of water is difﬁcult, because of their low concentrations. This would demand the examination of large volumes of the sample to detect the pathogenic organisms. The reasons are due to the following factors: • in a population, only a certain fraction suffers from water-borne diseases; • in the faeces of these inhabitants, the presence of pathogens may not occur",

Waterborne infections occur through ingestion of water contaminated with human or animal faeces, leading to diseases like diarrhoea and dysentery (caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli), cholera, gastroenteritis, and diseases caused by protozoa (e.g. giardiasis, amoebiasis), viruses (e.g. hepatitis A and E, rotavirus), and helminths (e.g. ascariasis, trichuriasis); prevention strategies include protecting and treating drinking water and avoiding use of contaminated water. Water-washed infections stem from insufficient water for personal and domestic hygiene, causing skin and eye infections, scabies, trachoma, and respiratory infections; prevention involves supplying adequate water and promoting hygiene. Water-based infections result from pathogens (usually helminths) that spend part of their life cycle in aquatic animals and penetrate skin or are ingested, leading to diseases like schistosomiasis, guinea worm, and others; preventive actions include avoiding contact with contaminated water, treating water sources, ensuring proper sanitation, and controlling intermediate hosts. Water-related infections are spread by insects breeding in or near water and transmitted by bites, such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, and others; they can be prevented by controlling insect vectors, destroying breeding grounds, avoiding contact with breeding sites, and using individual protection (e.g. sprays or nets).",

In this sense, the ﬁnal concentration of pathogens per unit volume in a water body may be considerably low, making detection through laboratory examination highly difﬁcult. This obstacle is overcome through the search for indicator organisms of faecal contamination. These organisms are predominantly non-pathogenic, but they give a satisfactory indication of whether the water is contaminated by human or animal faeces, and, therefore, of its potential to transmit diseases. The organisms most commonly used with this objective are bacteria of the coliform group. The following are the main reasons for the use of the coliform group as indicators of faecal contamination: • Coliforms are present in large quantities in human faeces (each individual excretes on average 1010 to 1011cells per day) (Branco and Rocha, 1979). About 1/3 to 1/5 of the weight of human faeces consist of bacteria from the coliform group. All individuals eliminate coliforms, and not only those who are ill, as is the case with pathogenic organisms. Thus the probability that the coliforms will be detected after the sewage discharge is much higher than with pathogenic organisms. • Coliforms present a slightly higher resistance in the water compared with the majority of enteric pathogenic bacteria. This characteristic is important, because they would not be good indicators of faecal contamination if they died faster than pathogenic organisms, and a sample without coliforms could still contain pathogens. On the other hand, if their mortality rate were much lower than that of pathogenic microorganisms, the coliforms would not be useful indicators, since their presence could unjustiﬁably make suspect a sample of puriﬁed water. These considerations apply mainly to pathogenic bacteria, since other microorganisms can present a higher resistance compared to coliforms. • The removal mechanisms for coliforms from water bodies, water treatment plants and WWTP are the same mechanisms used for pathogenic bacteria. In this way the removal of pathogenic bacteria is usually associated with the removal of coliforms. Other pathogenic organisms (such as protozoan cysts and helminth eggs), however, can be removed by different mechanisms. • The bacteriological techniques for coliform detection are quick and economic compared with those for pathogens.

    "text_to_embed": "The indicators of faecal contamination most commonly used are: • total coliforms (TC) • faecal coliforms (FC) or thermotolerant coliforms • Escherichia coli (EC). The group of total coliforms (TC) constitutes a large group of bacteria that have been isolated in water samples and in polluted and non polluted soils and plants, as well as from faeces from humans and other warm-blooded animals. This group was largely used in the past as an indicator, and continues to be used in some areas, although the difﬁculties associated with the occurrence of non-faecal bacteria are a problem (Thoman and Mueller, 1987). There is no quantiﬁable relation between TC and pathogenic microorganisms. The total coliforms could be understood in a simpliﬁed way as “environmental” coliforms, given their possible occurrence in non-contaminated water and soils, thus representing other free-living organisms, and not only the intestinal ones. For this reason, total coliforms should not be used as indicators of faecal contamination in surface waters. However, in the speciﬁc caseofpotablewatersupply,itisexpectedthattreatedwatershouldnotcontaintotal coliforms. These, if found, could suggest inadequate treatment, post contamination or excess of nutrients in the treated water. Under these conditions, total coliforms could be used as indicators of the water treatment efﬁciency and of the integrity of the water distribution system (WHO, 1993). Faecal coliforms (FC) are a group of bacteria predominantly originated from the intestinal tract of humans and other animals. This group encompasses the genus Escherichia and, to a lesser degree, species of Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Citrobacter (WHO, 1993). The test for FC is completed at a high temperature, aiming at suppressing bacteria of non-faecal origin (Thoman and Mueller, 1987). However, even under these conditions, the presence of non-faecal (free-living) bac- teria is possible, although in lower numbers compared with the total coliforms test. As a result, even the test for faecal coliforms does not guarantee that the contamina- tion is really faecal. For this reason, recently the faecal coliforms have been prefer- ably denominated thermotolerant coliforms, because of the fact that they are resistant to the high temperatures of the test, but are not necessarily faecal. When- ever in the present book reference is made to faecal coliforms (traditional in the literatureandintheenvironmentallegislationinvariouscountries),itshouldbeun- derstood,implicitly,themoreappropriateterminologyofthermotolerantcoliforms. Escherichia coli (EC) is the main bacterium of the faecal (thermotolerant) coliform group, being present in large numbers in the faeces from humans and animals.

Its laboratory detection is very simple, principally by recent ﬂuorogenic methods. Different from total and faecal coliforms, E. coli is the only that gives guarantee of exclusively faecal contamination. For this reason, there is a current tendency in using predominantly E. coli as indicator of faecal contamination.However,itsdetectiondoesnotguaranteethatthecontamination is from human origin, since E. coli can also be found in other animal faeces. There are some types of E. coli that are pathogenic, but this does not invalidate its concept as bacterial indicators of faecal contamination. The detection of faecal contamination, exclusively human, requires the use of complementary biochemical tests, which are not usually undertaken in routine analysis.",

For a Sample of Water bodies polluted by sewage, the Total coliform level is Reasonable, the Faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms level is High, and the E. coli level is Total. In both cases, the presence of E. coli (indicated as 'Total') is a strong guarantee of faecal contamination. Item: Guarantee that the faecal contamination is exclusively human For a Sample of Water bodies reasonably clean, the levels are None for Total coliform, Faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms, and E. coli. For a Sample of Water bodies polluted mainly by domestic sewage, the Total coliform level is Reasonable, while the Faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms level is High, and the E. coli level is also High. This suggests that high levels of faecal coliforms and E. coli are indicators of human faecal contamination. Item: Proportion of E. coli in the total count of coliforms For a Sample of Water bodies reasonably clean, the proportion is Variable for Total coliform and Variable for Faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms. Data for E. coli proportion relative to total coliforms is not provided (indicated by a dash). For a Sample of Water bodies polluted by domestic sewage, the proportion is Reasonable to high for Total coliform and High for Faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms. Data for E. coli proportion is not provided. For a Sample of Domestic sewage itself, the proportion is Very high for both Total coliform and Faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms. Data for E. coli proportion is not provided. In summary, the table shows that E. coli is a primary indicator for the presence of faecal contamination. High levels of both Faecal coliforms and E. coli point towards human faecal contamination. The proportion of E. coli within the total coliform count tends to be higher in more polluted water and domestic sewage. Figure 2.16 illustrates the relative distribution of the indicator, pathogenic and other forms of bacteria. Table 2.23 synthesises the application of the three groups of indicators discussed above. In sewage, E. coli is the predominant organism within the group of faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms, and the faecal (thermotolerant) coliforms are the pre- dominant group within the total coliforms. For water bodies, when doing the interpretation of the tests for indicators of faecal contamination, it is very impor- tant to carry out a sanitary survey of the catchment area. This survey helps in establishing the origin of the faecal contamination (presence of domestic sewage discharges or wastes from animals), complementing the information supplied by the laboratory tests.",

For the objectives of this book (wastewater treatment), the characterisation of the faecal origin is not so important, since it is already accepted that the wastewater will contain faecal matter and organisms. The indicator organisms are used, in this case, as indicators of the pathogen removal efﬁciency in the wastewater treatment process.The pathogenic organisms that can be represented are bacteria and viruses, since they are removed by the same mechanisms of the coli form bacteria . Protozoan cysts and helminth eggs, which are mainly removed by physical mechanisms, such as sedimentation and ﬁltration, are not well represented by coliform bacteria as indicators of treatment efﬁciency. There are various other indicator organisms proposed in the literature, each with its own advantages, disadvantages and applicability. Below some of these organisms are brieﬂy discussed. Faecal streptococci. The group of faecal streptococci comprises two main gen- era: Enterococcus and Streptococcus. The genus Enterococcus encompasses many species, the majority of them of faecal human origin; however, some species are from animal origin. All Enterococcus present high tolerance to adverse environ- mental conditions. The genus Streptococcus comprises the species S. bovis and S. equinus, which are abundant in animal faeces. Faecal streptococci seldom multi- ply in polluted waters, and are more resistant than E. coli and coliform bacteria (WHO, 1993). Because of these characteristics, they have been used as indicators for bathing waters. In the past, the ratio between the values of faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci (FC/FS ratio) was used to give an indication of the origin of the contamination, whether predominantly human or animal. High values of FC/FS would suggest predominantly human contamination, whereas low values of FC/FS would suggest predominantly animal contamination. More recent evidences indi- cate, however, that these relations are not applicable in a large number of situations, giving unreliable indications about the real origin or the contamination in various catchment areas. Sulphite-reducing clostridia. Clostridium perfringens is the most represen- tative species in this group, being normally present in faeces, although in much smaller numbers than E. coli. However, it is not exclusively of faecal origin and can be derived from other environmental sources. Clostridial spores can survive in water much longer than organisms of the coliform group and will also resist disin- fection. Their presence in disinfected waters may indicate deﬁciencies in treatment and that disinfectant-resistant pathogens could have survived treatment. Because of its longevity, it is best regarded as indicating intermittent or remote contamina- tion. However, false alarms may also result from its detection, which makes it",

Bacteriophages. For the indication of the presence of viruses, bacteriophages may be representative, owing to their similarities with the enteric human viruses. Bacteriophages are speciﬁc viruses that infect bacteria, for example the coliphages, which infect E. coli. Coliphages are not present in high numbers in fresh human or animal faeces, but may be abundant in sewage, owing to their fast reproduction rate",

Helmintheggs.Forhelminths,therearenosubstitutingindicators,andhelminth eggs are determined directly in laboratory tests. However, the eggs of nematodes, suchasAscaris,Trichuris,NecatoramericanusandAncilostomaduodenalemaybe used as indicators of other helminths (cestodes, trematodes and other nematodes), which are removed in water and wastewater treatment by the same mechanism (e.g. sedimentation), being thus indicators of treatment efﬁciency. Helminth eggs are an important parameter when assessing the use of water or treated wastewater for irrigation, in which workers may have direct contact with contaminated water and consumers may eat the irrigated vegetable uncooked or unpeeled. Helminth eggs may be removed by physical operations, such as sedimentation, which takes place, for instance, in stabilisation ponds. Eggs may be viable or non-viable, and viability may be altered by speciﬁc disinfection processes. This topic is under constant development, and the present text does not aim to go deeper into speciﬁc items, covering only the more general and simpliﬁed concepts. 2.2.4 Relationship between load and concentration Before presenting the typical concentrations of the main pollutants in sewage, it is important to be clear about the concepts of per capita, load and constituent concentration. Per capita load represents the average contribution of each individual (ex- pressed in terms of pollutant mass) per unit time. A commonly used unit is grams per inhabitant per day (g/inhab.d). For example, when the BOD contribution is 54 g/inhab.d, it is equivalent to saying that every individual discharges 54 grams of BOD on average, per day. The inﬂuent load to a WWTP corresponds to the quantity of pollutant (mass) per unit time. In this way, import relations are load = population × per capita load (2.7) load (kg/d) = population (inhab) × per capita load (g/inhab.d) / 1000 (g/kg) (2.8) or load = concentration × ﬂow (2.9) load (kg/d) = concentration (g/m3) × ﬂow (m3/d) / 1000 (g/kg) (2.10) Note: g/m3 = mg/L",

The following concepts are important in terms of the biological treatment of industrial wastewater: • Biodegradability: capacity of the wastewater to be stabilised through bio- chemical processes by microorganisms. • Treatability: suitability of the waste to be treated by conventional or ex- isting biological processes. • Biodegradable organic matter concentration: BOD of the wastewa- ter, which can be: (a) higher than in domestic sewage (predominantly biodegradable organic wastewater, treatable through biological processes), or (b) lower than in domestic sewage (predominately inorganic or un- biodegradable wastewater, in which there is less need for BOD removal, but in which the pollutional load can be expressed in terms of other quality parameters) • Nutrient availability: biological wastewater treatment requires a balanced equilibrium between the nutrients C:N:P. This equilibrium is usually found in domestic sewage. • Toxicity: certain industrial wastewaters have toxic or inhibitory con- stituents that can affect or render biological treatment unfeasible. Figure 2.18 presents the main options for the treatment and discharge of indus- trial efﬂuents. The integration of industrial wastewater with domestic sewage in the public sewerage system, for subsequent combined treatment in a WWTP, may be an interesting alternative. Possible reasons for this alternative would be economy of scale, dilution of undesirable constituents, revenue for the sanitation company for transporting and treating the industrial wastewater, simpliﬁcation for the industries. However, for this practice to be effective, it is necessary that previous removal from the industrial efﬂuent is practised for the constituents that may pose one or more of the following problems: • Safety risks and problems in the operation of the sewerage collection and interception system. • Toxicity to the biological treatment. • Toxicity to the sludge treatment and its ﬁnal disposal. • Persistence of contaminants in the efﬂuent of the biological treatment, because of the fact that they have not been removed by the treatment. The water and sanitation company, to receive the industrial wastewaters, must have speciﬁc standards for the discharge of industrial efﬂuents into the public sewerage system. If a pollutant leads to one of the above problems, the industry must pre-treat the wastewater, in order to place the efﬂuent within the standards of the Sanitation Company for discharge into the public sewerage system. The industry can opt for complete treatment and discharge the industrial efﬂuent directly into the receiving water body. In this case, the efﬂuents must comply with",

Another option is for the industry to completely treat the efﬂuent and use it for other purposes (example: irrigation), or recycle it as process water along the production line. Naturally, public health implications need to be well addressed and guidelines or standards for reuse need to be satisﬁed. 2.2.6.2 Pollutants of importance in industrial wastewaters Industrial efﬂuents, depending on the type of the industrial process, can contain in greater or lesser degrees, the various pollutants described in Section 2.2.3, which are present in domestic sewage (suspended solids, biodegradable organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and pathogenic organisms). The present section covers other pollutants, which are not usually found in typical domestic sewage, but which can be of concern in industrial or municipal wastewaters containing a fraction of industrial efﬂuents. The text is based on da Silva et al (2001). a) Metals In the present context, the main implications of metals are: • Toxicity to human beings and other forms of plant or animal life, as a result of the discharge or disposal of wastewaters to receiving water bodies or land. • Inhibition to the microorganisms responsible for the biological treatment of wastewater. In spite of being widely used, the expression “heavy metal” does not have a sole deﬁnition, varying from branch to branch of science. From the environmental point of view of this book, heavy metals can be understood as those that, under certain concentrations and exposure time, offer risks to human health and the environment, impairing the activity of living organisms, including those responsible for the biological treatment of wastewater. The main chemical elements that ﬁt into this category are: Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se and Zn. These elements may be naturally found in soils or waters in variable concentrations, but lower than those ones considered toxic to different living organisms. Among these, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Se and Zn are essential to organisms in certain small quantities, while others have no function in biological metabolism, being toxic to plants and animals. Most living organisms need only few metals, and in very small doses, charac- terising the concept of micronutrients, as zinc, magnesium, cobalt and iron. These metals become toxic and dangerous to human health when they exceed certain concentration thresholds. As for lead, mercury and cadmium, these are metals",

Summary of the sources of contamination and the effects on human health by metals most frequently found in environment: Cadmium contamination comes from refined flours, cigarettes, odontological materials, steel industry, industrial gaseous effluents, fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, coffee and tea treated with agrotoxics, ceramics, seafood, bone meal, welding, casting and refining of metals like zinc, lead and copper, and its derivatives are used in pigments, batteries, electroplating, accumulators, PVC stabilisers, and nuclear reactors; it causes cancer, high blood pressure, heart swelling, reduced immunity, prostate growth, bone weakening, joint pain, anaemia, pulmonary emphysema, osteoporosis, smell loss, and reduced sexual performance. Lead is found in car batteries, paints, fuels, plants treated with agrotoxics, bovine liver, canned foods, cigarettes, pesticides, hair paint, leaded gas, newspapers, adverts, fertilizers, cosmetics, and air pollution, leading to irritability, aggressiveness, convulsions, memory issues, hallucinations, kidney and digestive problems, and is a teratogen. Mercury is sourced from thermometers, pesticides, agrotoxics, dental alloys, mining, polishes, sugar, contaminated tomato and fish, lamps, cosmetics, petroleum by-products, and chlorine production, causing depression, fatigue, panic syndrome, loss of motor and sexual function, hallucinations, anorexia in children, and severe pain. Nickel from kitchenware, batteries, jewelry, cosmetics, hydrogenated oils, pottery, cold permanent waves, and welding is carcinogenic and causes skin and oral conditions, dizziness, joint pain, and chronic fatigue. Zinc from metallurgy and recycling causes a sweet taste, dry throat, cough, weakness, vomiting, and fever. Chromium used in leather tanning and electroplating results in dermatitis, ulcers, inflammation, lung cancer, and nose septum perforation. Arsenic contamination from fuel oil, pesticides, herbicides, metallurgy, and sea plants/animals causes gastrointestinal and muscular disturbances, spasms, nausea, diarrhea, and throat inflammation. Aluminium from water, processed cheese, wheat flour, kitchenware, cosmetics, anti-acids, pesticides, antiperspirants, and salt leads to constipation, energy loss, abdominal issues, memory and learning problems, and is linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Barium found in polluted water, agrotoxics, pesticides, and fertilizers causes high blood pressure, heart diseases, fatigue, and discouragement.",

    "text_to_embed": "In human beings, metals can produce several effects, resulting from their ac- tion on molecules, cells, tissues, organs and even the whole system. Besides, the presence of a metal might restrict the absorption of other nutrients essential to the activity of the organism. Metals, because they cannot be metabolised, remain in the organism and carry out their toxic effects, combining with one or more reactive groups, which may be indispensable for normal physiological functions. Depend- ing on the material involved and on the intensity of the intoxication, the effect may range from a topic skin manifestation, pulmonary membrane or digestive tract, to mutagenic, teratogenic or carcinogenic effects, and even death. It is important to emphasise that synergistic effects also need to be taken into account. In most cases, synergistic effects might be far greater than the mere sum of the individual effects. Although in general metals may be poisonous to plants and animals under the low concentrations in which they may be present in domestic wastewater, no chronic toxicity problems associated with their disposal have been reported. On the other hand, the same could not be said for industrial wastewaters and the resulting sludges (in which metals are concentrated). Table 2.26 summarises the main sources of contamination from some metals, together with their effects on human health. In wastewater treatment, limitations associated with metals are mainly related to the inhibition of, or toxicity to, microorganism growth and the incorporation of metals in the sludge. For a certain metal, the maximum allowable load needs to be determined, such that there are no problems with microorganism inhibi- tion, deterioration of efﬂuent quality and impairment to agricultural use of the sludge. The discharge of a particular industrial wastewater into the public sewerage system will have a variable impact in the WWTP, depending on the dilution factor, the be determined, such that there are no problems with microorganism inhibi- tion, deterioration of efﬂuent quality and impairment to agricultural use of the sludge. The discharge of a particular industrial wastewater into the public sewerage system will have a variable impact in the WWTP, depending on the dilution factor, the content and type of pollutant, and the treatment process employed. To analyse the impact, it is interesting to perform simulations and to apply a safety factor",

To analyse the impact, it is interesting to perform simulations and to apply a safety factor to the calculated limits. In this way, decisions may be made regarding the accep- tance of the efﬂuents into the system, and ﬁnally at the WWTP. If the estimated loads are lower than the acceptable limits, the discharge may be accepted. Con- versely, if the limits are exceeded, pre-treatment may be required, or no further admissions to the public systems may be accepted. A check must be made on the system to verify whether the biological process is being inhibited, or whether the treated efﬂuent and the sludge to be reused are outside the limits established by the environmental agency. The control must be centred on the industrial discharges, since domestic sewage may not be prevented to be discharged to the public network system. b) Toxic and dangerous organic compounds Like the section on metals, this text is also based on da Silva et al (2001). Toxic and dangerous organic compounds, even though they usually do not represent a concern in domestic sewage, may be of concern in municipal wastewaters that receive industrial efﬂuents. When wastewaters containing toxic organic compounds are disposed of in the receiving water body without adequate treatment, severe damage may occur, both to the aquatic life and to human beings, who use it as a source of water supply. Most of these compounds are very slowly biodegraded, persisting in the environ- ment for a long period. These compounds are able to penetrate the food chain and, even if they are not detectable in the receiving body, they may be present in large quantities in the higher trophic levels, owing to their bioaccumulation char- acteristics. Another important fact is that, although some compounds do not pose serious health damages when ingested, their metabolites may be more toxic than the original products. Besides, since wastewaters have a complex composition and normally contain more than one organic pollutant, synergistic effects may take place (the combined effect may be higher than the sum of the individually exerted effects). Several dangerous pollutants are volatile because of their low solubility, low molecular weight and high vapour pressure. Therefore, they may be transferred to the atmosphere in open units in the WWTP, such as aeration tanks, equalisation tanks and clariﬁers, and also pumping stations. If adequate control means are not taken, their volatilisation represents a potential health risk to the population and workers who are frequently exposed",

If adequate control means are not taken, their volatilisation represents a potential health risk to the population and workers who are frequently exposed to it. The structural integrity of the sewerage collection system is also affected, because many compounds are corrosive, in- ﬂammable and explosive (methanol, methyl-ethylketone, hexane, benzene, among others). Other pollutants are adsorbed and concentrated in the biological ﬂocs in the treatment process, and might cause inhibition to sludge digestion or generate sludge with dangerous characteristics which, if not adequately disposed of, could contaminate groundwater. In some cases, the toxic pollutants are present in such low concentrations, that are not able to inhibit the biological process, but also are very hard to be removed.",

In some cases, the toxic pollutants are present in such low concentrations, that are not able to inhibit the biological process, but also are very hard to be removed. Consequently, the treatment plant efﬂuent may still contain these pollutants and, when discharged into the receiving body, may cause damages to the aquatic life and human beings. There are relatively few data on the behaviour of these dangerous pollutants in WWTPs. The lack of knowledge of their physical, chemical and biochemi- cal characteristics, as well as their inter-relationships in complex wastewaters, makes it extremely difﬁcult to predict their treatability and destination during the treatment processes. More research is required for the identiﬁcation of many com- pounds, understanding of their removal mechanisms and development of predictive models. The main sources of organic compounds are: chemical and plastic industries, mechanical products, pharmaceutical industries, pesticide formulation, casthouses and steel industries, oil industry, laundries and lumber industries. The most commonly found organic pollutants in industrial efﬂuents are: phenol, methyl chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, toluene, ethyl benzene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, chloroform, bis-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate, 2,4-dimethyl phe- nol, naphthalene, butylbenzylphthalate, acrolein, xylene, cresol, acetophenone, methyl-sobutyl-acetone, diphenylamine, aniline and ethyl acetate. 2.2.6.3 Population equivalent Population equivalent (PE) is an important parameter for characterising indus- trial wastewaters. PE reﬂects the equivalence between the polluting potential of an industry (commonly in terms of biodegradable organic matter) and a certain pop- ulation, which produces the same polluting load. For instance, when an industry is said to have a population equivalent of 20,000 habitants, it is the equivalent to saying that the BOD load of the industrial efﬂuent corresponds to the load gener- ated by a community with a population of 20,000 inhabitants. The formula for the calculation of population equivalent based on BOD is: PE (population equivalent) = BOD load from industry (kg/d) / per capita BOD load (kg/inhab.d) (2.13) In the case of adopting the value frequently used in the international literature for the per capita BOD load of 54 gBOD/inhab.d, PE may be calculated by: PE (population equivalent) = BOD load from industry (kg/d) / 0.054 (kg/inhab.d) (2.14) When reporting a value of population equivalent, it is important to make clear the per capita load used as a reference (54 gBOD/inhab.d or other value, more applicable to the region under analysis).",

The population forecast for the project produced the values presented in the table below. The coverage (served population / total population) is 60% at the beginning of operation (year 0), reaching, as a target, the value of 100% from year 5. The length of the sewerage collection system is estimated to be 30 km for year 0, increasing to 55 km in year 5 (to sustain the increase in the coverage). From this year, it expands at a rate of 1 km per year. The town has one dairy industry that processes around 5,000 litres of milk per day, for the production of milk, cheese and butter. There are provisions for expansion at year 10, when the production will be doubled. Owing to lack of time and other conditions during the design period, it was not possible to obtain samples for characterising the actual sewage composition. Assume adequate values for the missing variables and establish suitable hypotheses for the various parameters in the calculations. 2.2.7.2 Flow estimation a) Domestic ﬂow • Average ﬂow Assume: • per capita water consumption: Lpcd = 160 L/inhab.d (see Tables 2.5 and 2.7) • return coefﬁcient (sewage ﬂow/water ﬂow): R = 0.8 (see Sec- tion 2.1.2.4) The average ﬂow for year 0 is (Equation 2.2): QQ_dav = (Pop.L_pcd.R) / 1000 = (24,000 × 160 × 0.8) / 1000 = 3,072 m³/d (= 35.6 L/s) The ﬂows for the other years are calculated in a similar way, changing only the population. • Maximum ﬂow Adopting the Harmon formula (Table 2.10), the Qmax/Qav ratio is calculated for the population of every year. For year 0: Q_max / Q_av = 1 + 14 / (4 + sqrt(P)) = 1 + 14 / (4 + sqrt(24,000/1,000)) = 2.57",

Therefore, for year 0: Qmax = 2.57 × 35.6 l/s = 91.5 L/s The ratios and ﬂows for the other years are calculated in a similar manner, altering only the value P (population/1000). • Minimum ﬂow Adopt a Qmin/Qav equal to 0.5. The Qmin values are obtained by multiplication with the ratio Qmin/Qav. Therefore, for year 0: Qmin = 0.5 × 35.6 L/s = 17.8 L/s The ratios and the ﬂows for the other years are calculated in a similar manner. b) Inﬁltration ﬂow Adopt Qinf = 0.3 L/s.km for the sewerage system. Consider the resulting ﬂow value for each year occurring only in the average and maximum ﬂows. For year 0: Qinf = 30 km. 0.3 L/s.km = 9.0 L/s (= 778 m3/d) The ﬂows for the other years are calculated in a similar manner, remembering that, from year 5, for each year the sewerage system increases by 1 km. c) Industrial wastewater ﬂow Adopt a value of 7 m3 of wastewater produced per 1000 L of milk processed (water consumption being equal to wastewater production) (see Table 2.28). Consider that for the years 0 and 5, 5,000 L of milk per day are processed and that for the years 10, 15 and 20, 10,000 L/d of milk are processed (given in the problem).

Later in the chapter, water quality legislation is discussed, introducing the concepts of discharge standard and quality standard for the wa- ter body. The importance of the chapter is related to the planning of the removal efﬁciency and efﬂuent quality to be achieved in the WWTP. 3.2 POLLUTION BY ORGANIC MATTER AND STREAM SELF PURIFICATION 3.2.1 Introduction The present section covers one of the main problems of water pollution, largely solved in most developed regions but still of great importance in developing C⃝2007 IWA Publishing.

The introduction of organic matter into a water body results, indirectly, in the consumption of dissolved oxygen. This occurs as a result of the processes of the stabilisation of the organic matter undertaken by bacteria, which use the oxygen available in the liquid medium for their respiration. As expected, the decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water body has various implications from the environmental point of view. The objective of this section is the study of the processes of consumption of dissolved oxygen and of stream self-puriﬁcation, in which the water body recovers itself, through purely natural mechanisms. Both of these processes are analysed from an ecological viewpoint and, subsequently, more speciﬁcally through the mathematical representation of the DO proﬁle in the water body. In broader terms, the process of self-puriﬁcation is associated with the re- establishment of the equilibrium of the aquatic ecosystem, after the alterations in- duced bytheefﬂuentdischarge.Withinamorespeciﬁcpointofview,theconversion of organic compounds into inert compounds, not deleterious from an ecological viewpoint, is an integral part of the process. It should be understood that the concept of self-puriﬁcation presents the same relativity as the concept of pollution (see Chapter 1). Water can be considered puri- ﬁed from one point of view, even if not fully puriﬁed in hygienic terms, presenting, for instance, pathogenic organisms. From a pragmatic approach, water could be considered puriﬁed when its characteristics are not conﬂicting anymore with their intended uses in each reach of the watercourse. This is because there is no absolute puriﬁcation: the ecosystem reaches a new equilibrium, but under conditions that are different from before (upstream), owing to the increase in the concentrations of certaincompoundsandby-productsresultingfromthedecompositionprocess.Asa consequence, the aquatic community is different, even if at a new equilibrium state. The knowledge and quantiﬁcation of the self-puriﬁcation phenomenon is very important, because of the following objectives: • To use the assimilation capacity of the rivers. From a strictly ecological point of view, it could be argued that ecosystems should remain unaltered. However, from a pragmatic perspective, it can be considered that the capac- ity of a water body to assimilate discharges, without presenting environ- mental problems, is a natural resource that can be exploited. This realistic vision is of great importance in developing countries where the lack of ﬁ- nancial resources justiﬁes the use of",

    "text_to_embed": "3.2.2 Ecological aspects of stream self puriﬁcation The ecosystem of a water body upstream of the discharge of untreated wastewater is usually in a state of equilibrium. Downstream of the discharge, the equilibrium between the communities is affected, resulting in an initial disorganisation followed by a subsequent tendency towards rearrangement. In this sense, self-puriﬁcation can be understood as a phenomenon of ecological succession. Along the river, there is a systematic sequence of replacements of a community by another, until a stable community is established, in equilibrium with the local conditions. The presence or absence of pollution can be characterised by the concept of species diversity: Ecosystem in natural conditions: • High number of species • Low number of individuals in each species Ecosystem under disturbance: • Low number of species • High number of individuals in each species A reduction in the diversity of the species is due to the fact that the pollu- tion is selective for the species: only those that adapt to the new environmental conditions survive and, further, proliferate (resulting in a high number of indi- viduals in these few species). The other species do not resist to the new envi- ronmental conditions and perish (leading to a reduction in the total number of species). Because self-puriﬁcation is a process that develops with time, and considering the dimension of the river as predominantly longitudinal, the stages of ecological succession can be associated with physically identiﬁable zones in the river. There are four main zones: • Degradation zone • Active decomposition zone • Recovery zone • Clean water zone These zones occur downstream of the discharge of a predominantly biodegrad- able organic wastewater. It should be remembered that upstream of the discharge there is a clean water zone characterised by ecological equilibrium and good wa- ter quality. Figure 3.1 presents the trajectory along the four zones of the three main water quality parameters: organic matter, heterotrophic bacteria (feeding on organic matter) and dissolved oxygen.",

    "text_to_embed": "DEGRADATION ZONE General characteristics: This zone starts soon after the discharge of wastewater to the water body. The main chemical characteristic is the high concentration of organic matter, still in a complex stage but potentially decomposable. Aesthetic aspects: At the discharge point, water is turbid due to the solids present in the sewage. The sedimentation of the solids results in the formation of sludge banks. Organic matter and dissolved oxygen: In this zone there is complete disorder, compared to the stable community that existed before. Decomposition of the organic matter, carried out by microorganisms, can have a slow start, depending on the adaptation of the microorganisms to the waste. Normally, in the case of predominantly organic wastewater, the microorganisms present in the wastewater itself are those responsible for the start of the decomposition. Because the decomposition can still be incipient, the oxygen consumption for the respiratory activities of the microorganisms can also be low, allowing sufﬁcient dissolved oxygen for ﬁsh. After the adaptation of the microorganisms, the consumption rate of the organic matter becomes high, also implying a high rate of dissolved oxygen consumption. Microorganisms: After the adaptation period, bacteria start to proliferate, with a massive predominance of aerobic forms, that is, those that depend on the oxygen available in the medium for their metabolic processes. Bacteria, having an abundance of food in the form of the organic matter introduced by the wastewater and also with sufﬁcient oxygen for their respiration, have excellent conditions for development and reproduction. The quantity of organic matter is at a maximum at the discharge point and, due to the consumption by microorganisms, starts to decrease. Decomposition by-products: There is an increase in the levels of carbon dioxide, one of the products of the microbial respiratory process. With the increase in CO2 concentration, which is then converted into carbonic acid in water, water may become more acidic and pH may decrease. Bottom sludge: Anaerobic conditions start to prevail in the sludge at the bottom, due to the difﬁculty in gas exchange with the atmosphere. As a consequence, there is a production of hydrogen sulphide, which is a potential generator of unpleasant smell.

    "text_to_embed": "ACTIVE DECOMPOSITION ZONE General characteristics: After the initial disturbance, the ecosystem begins to organise itself. Microorganisms, present in large numbers, actively decompose organic matter. The impact reaches the highest levels and water quality is at its worst state. Aesthetic aspects: The strongest water colouration can still be observed, together with the dark deposits of sludge at the bottom. Organic matter and dissolved oxygen: In this zone the dissolved oxygen reaches its lowest concentration. Depending on the magnitude of the discharge, dissolved oxygen may be completely consumed by the microorganisms. In this situation, anaerobic conditions occur in all the liquid bulk. Aerobic life disappears, giving way to predominantly anaerobic microorganisms. Microorganisms: Bacteria begin to reduce in number, mainly due to the reduction in the available food, which has been largely stabilised. Other factors still interact in the decrease of bacteria, such as light, ﬂocculation, adsorption and sedimentation. Decomposition by-products: In the event of anaerobic reactions taking place, by-products are, besides carbon dioxide and water, methane, hydrogen sulphide, mercaptans and others, many of them responsible for the generation of bad odours. Nitrogen: Nitrogen is still present in the organic form, although the larger part is already in the form of ammonia. At the end of the zone, in the presence of dissolved oxygen, oxidation of ammonia to nitrite may start. Aquatic community: The number of enteric bacteria, pathogenic or not, decreases rapidly. This is due to the fact that these bacteria, well adapted to the environmental conditions in the human intestinal tract, do not resist to the new environmental conditions, which are adverse to their survival. The number of protozoans increases, leading to the rising to a new level in the food pyramid, in the ecological succession process. The presence of some macroorganisms occurs along with insect larvae, adapted to survive under the prevailing conditions. However, the macro fauna is still restricted in species. Hydras, sponges, crustaceans, molluscs and ﬁsh have not yet returned. RECOVERY ZONE General characteristics: After the intense phase of organic matter consumption and degradation of the aquatic environment, the recovery stage commences. Aesthetic aspects: Water is clearer and its general appearance is improved. Sludge deposits at the bottom present a less ﬁne and more granulated texture. There is no release of gases or bad smells.

Nitrogen: Ammonia is converted into nitrite and the nitrite to nitrate. Also the phosphorus compounds are transformed into phosphates. A fertilisation of the medium takes place because of the presence of nitrates and phosphates, which are nutrients for algae. Algae: Due to the presence of nutrients and the higher transparency of the water (allowing a larger light penetration), there are conditions for development of algae. With them, there is the production of oxygen by photosynthesis, increasing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the medium. Also as a result of the presence of algae, the food web becomes more diversiﬁed. Aquatic community: The number of bacteria is now small and, as a result, so is the number of protozoan bacteriophages. Algae are under full development: the ﬁrst ones to appear are the blue algae (cyanobacteria) on the surface and banks, followed by ﬂagellates, green algae and ﬁnally diatoms. Microcrustaceans occur in their maximum number. Molluscs, various worms, dinoﬂagellates, sponges and insect larvae are present at high numbers. The food chain is more diversiﬁed, generating food for the ﬁrst more tolerant ﬁshes. CLEAN WATER ZONE General characteristics: Water is clean again. Conditions are similar to those upstream of the discharge, at least in respect to dissolved oxygen, organic matter and bacteria levels, and probably pathogenic organisms. Aesthetic aspects: The appearance of the water is similar to that before the pollution occurred. Organic matter and dissolved oxygen: In the liquid there is a predominance of the completely oxidised and stable forms of inorganic matter, although sludge at the bottom may not be necessarily stabilised. The concentration of dissolved oxygen is close to the saturation level, owing to the low consumption by the microbial population and possibly high production by the algae. Aquatic community: Because of the mineralisation that occurred in the previous zone, water is now richer in nutrients than before the pollution. Therefore, the production of algae is higher. There is the re-establishment of the normal food web. Various organisms, including large freshwater crustacea, molluscs and ﬁsh are present. Species diversity is high. The ecosystem is now stable and the community reaches its climax again.",

The impact is extended to all the aquatic community, and each reduction in the level of the dissolved oxygen is selective for certain species. Dissolved oxygen has been traditionally used for the determination of the degree of pollution and self puriﬁcation in water bodies. Its measurement is simple and its level can be expressed in quantiﬁable concentrations, allowing mathematical modelling. Water is an environment poor of oxygen, by virtue of its low solubility. While in the air its concentration is in the order of 270 mg/L, in water, at normal conditions of temperature and pressure, its concentration is reduced approximately to only 9 mg/L. In this way, any large consumption brings substantial impacts in the DO level in the liquid mass.",

Oxygen consumption mechanisms include oxidation of the organic matter (respiration), benthic demand (sludge at the bottom), and nitrification (ammonia oxidation). Oxygen production mechanisms are atmospheric reaeration and photosynthesis. In the self-puriﬁcation process there is a balance between the sources of con- sumption and the sources of production of oxygen. When the consumption rate is higher than the production rate, the oxygen concentration tends to decrease, the opposite occurring when the consumption rate is lower than the production rate. The main interacting mechanisms in the DO balance in a water body can be found in Figure 3.2 and Table 3.1. In general, the concentrations of the constituents (such as DO) in a water body change as a result of physical processes of advec- tion (transportation by the water as it ﬂows in the river channel) and dispersion (transportation due to turbulence and molecular diffusion) and biochemical and physical processes of conversion (reaction) (Fig. 3.3). The processes take place in the three dimensions of the water body, although in rivers the longitudinal axis (X) is the prevailing one. The mechanisms listed in Table 3.1 are associated with conversion processes.

    "text_to_embed": "Oxygen consumption a) Oxidation of the organic matter The organic matter in sewage is present in two forms: suspended (particulate) and dissolved (soluble). Settleable suspended solids tend to settle in the water body, forming a sludge layer at the bottom. The dissolved matter, together with the suspended solids of small dimensions (hardly settleable) remains in the liquid mass. The oxidation of the latter fraction of organic matter corresponds to the main factor in the oxygen consumption. The consumption of DO is due to the respi- ration of the microorganisms responsible for the oxidation, principally aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. The simpliﬁed equation for the stabilisation (oxidation) of organic material is: Organic matter + O2 + bacteria →CO2 + H2O + bacteria + energy (3.1) Bacteria, in the presence of oxygen, convert the organic matter to simple and inert compounds, such as water and carbon dioxide. As a result, bacteria tend to grow and reproduce, generating more bacteria, while there is availability of food (organic matter) and oxygen in the medium. b) Benthic (sediment) demand The settled organic matter in suspension, which formed the bottom sludge layer, also needs to be stabilised. A large part of the conversion is completed under anaerobic conditions, because of the difﬁculty of oxygen to penetrate the sludge layer. This form of conversion, being anaerobic, implies the non- consumption of oxygen. However, the upper part of the sludge layer, in the order of some millimetres of thickness, still has access to oxygen from the supernatant water. The sludge stabilisation is completed under aerobic conditions in this ﬁne layer, resulting in the consumption of oxygen. Besides, some partial by-products of the anaerobic decomposition may dissolve, cross the aerobic sludge layer and diffuse itself in",

Besides, some partial by-products of the anaerobic decomposition may dissolve, cross the aerobic sludge layer and diffuse itself in the bulk of the liquid, exerting an oxygen demand. The oxygen demand originat- ing from these combined factors associated with the sludge is called benthic (or sediment) demand. Another factor that can cause oxygen demand is the reintroduction of previously settled organic matter into the bulk of the liquid, caused by the resuspension of the sludge layer. This resuspension occurs in occasions of high ﬂows and velocities in the water course. The sludge, not yet completely stabilised, represents a new source of oxygen demand. The importance of the benthic demand and the resuspension of the sludge in the dissolved oxygen balance depends on a series of simultaneously interacting factors, many of them difﬁcult to quantify. c) Nitriﬁcation Another oxidation process is the one associated with the conversion of ammonia into nitrite and this nitrite into nitrate, in the process of nitriﬁcation. The microorganisms involved in this process are chemoautotrophs, which have carbon dioxide as the main carbon source and which draw their energy from the oxidation of an inorganic substrate, such as ammonia. The transformation of ammonia into nitrite is completed according to the fol- lowing simpliﬁed reaction: ammonia + O2 →nitrite + H+ + H2O + energy (3.2) The transformation of nitrite into nitrate occurs in sequence, in accordance with the following simpliﬁed reaction: nitrite + O2 →nitrate + energy (3.3) It is seen that in both reactions there is oxygen consumption. This consumption is referred to as nitrogenous demand or second-stage demand, because it takes place after the oxidation of most of the carbonaceous matter. This is due to the fact that the nitrifying bacteria have a slower growth rate compared with the heterotrophic bacteria, implying that nitriﬁcation also occurs at a slower rate. Oxygen production a) Atmospheric reaeration Atmospheric reaeration is frequently the main factor responsible for the introduc- tion of oxygen into the liquid medium. Gas transfer is a physical phenomenon, through which gas molecules are ex- changed between the liquid and the gas at their interface. This exchange results in an increase in the concentration in the liquid gas phase, if this phase is not saturated with gas. This is what happens in a water body, in which the DO concentration is reduced due to the processes of the stabilisation of the organic matter. As a consequence, DO",

This is what happens in a water body, in which the DO concentration is reduced due to the processes of the stabilisation of the organic matter. As a consequence, DO levels are lower than the saturation concentration, which is given by the solubility of the gas at a given temperature and pressure. In this situation there is an oxygen deﬁcit. If there is a deﬁcit, there is the search for a new equilibrium, thus allowing a larger absorption by the liquid mass. The transfer of oxygen from the gas phase to the liquid phase occurs basically through the following two mechanisms: • Molecular diffusion • Turbulent diffusion In a quiescent water body, molecular diffusion prevails. This diffusion may be described as a tendency of any substance to uniformly spread itself about all of the available space. However, this mechanism is very slow and requires a long time for the gas to reach the deepest layers of the water body. Themechanismofturbulentdiffusionismuchmoreefﬁcient,becauseitinvolves the main factors of an effective aeration: creation of interfaces and renewal of interfaces. The ﬁrst one is important, because it is through these interfaces that gas exchange occurs. The second one is also signiﬁcant, because the fast renewal of the interfaces permits that localised saturation points are not formed, besides conducting the dissolved gas to the various depths of the liquid mass, as a result of the mixing. The diffusion condition to prevail is a function of the hydrodynamic character- istics of the water body. A shallow river with rapids presents excellent conditions for an efﬁcient turbulence. In these conditions, molecular diffusion is negligible. On the other hand, in lakes, molecular diffusion tends to predominate, unless wind promotes good mixing and interface renewal. b) Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the main process used by autotrophic organisms to synthesise organic matter, being a characteristic of organisms containing chlorophyll. The process takes place only in the presence of light energy, according to the following simpliﬁed equation (there are many intermediate steps): CO2 + H2O + light energy →organic matter + O2 (3.4) Photosynthesis reaction is exactly opposite to the respiration reaction. While photosynthesis is a process of ﬁxing light energy and forming glucose molecules of high energy potential, respiration is essentially the opposite, that is, release of this energy for subsequent use in metabolic processes (Branco, 1976). Light dependence controls the distribution of photosynthetic organisms to loca- tions to where light is present.

This model represented a milestone in water and environmental engineering. Subsequently, various other models were developed, including the model of Camp (1954), increasing the level of complexity and the number of state and input variables, but at the same time maintaining the same conceptual structure of the classic Streeter–Phelps model. A widely known model, within the relatively recent generation of models, is the QUAL2E model, developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), which represents in greater depth the cycles of O, N and P in water.

For developing countries, with all the large regional diversity of problems and solutions concerning water quality, it is difﬁcult to establish generalisations about the use of models. However it is always important to have in mind that all the water quality models mentioned have been developed in countries that have al- ready practically solved their basic pollution problems, such as the discharge of raw wastewater containing organic matter (domestic and industrial). In these con- ditions, it is natural that attention is now given to transient events and diffused pollution, for example. Nevertheless, in most of the developing counties the basic problems have not yet been solved, and simpler models still have a large contribu- tion to give for the adequate management of water resources. b) Simpliﬁed models In the present text, for the sake of simplicity, only the two main components in the DO balance are covered, namely: • oxygen consumption: oxidation of organic matter (respiration) • oxygen production: atmospheric reaeration. Naturally there are cases that justify the inclusion of other components, when it is felt that these are important in the DO balance. However, ﬁeld and laboratory work for a reliable evaluation of these parameters needs to be undertaken inten- sively and rigorously, substantially increasing the complexity level of the study. The adoption of sophisticated mathematical models demands the availability of time and ﬁnancial resources compatible with the proposed formulation, what is frequently not the case in developing countries. Therefore, in the present text, the more simpliﬁed version of the model (Streeter–Phelps version) is adopted, allow- ing an easier identiﬁcation of occasional problems in its structure and parameter values. Another important point is that any user of a sophisticated model should un- derstand well the basic principles of the Streeter–Phelps model, in order to avoid a blind use of the computer software, without knowing the basic processes that are being represented.

There are basically three types of hydraulic models for a water body: (a) plug ﬂow, (b) complete mix, (c) dispersed ﬂow body or a reactor (see Figure 3.4): • Plug ﬂow • Complete mix • Dispersed ﬂow A water body in the ideal complete-mix regime is characterised by having the same concentration at all points in the liquid mass. Thus, the efﬂuent concentration is equal at whatever point in the water body. This representation is usually applied to well-mixed lakes and reservoirs. This regime is also called CSTR (completely- stirred tank reactor). A predominantly linear water body, such as a river, can be characterised through the plug-ﬂow regime. In the ideal plug ﬂow there are no exchanges between the upstream and downstream sections. Each section functions as a plug, in which the water quality is the same in all points and the community is adapted to the ecolog- ical conditions prevailing in each moment. Along with the downstream movement of the plug, the various self-puriﬁcation reactions take place. Hydraulically, this model is similar to the case in which a tank with water, equal to the plug, re- mains the same period of time subjected to the same reactions and processes, therefore having the same water quality as that of the plug in the water body (see Figure 3.5). The two characteristics represented above are for idealised situations. In re- ality, water bodies present a characteristic of dispersion of the pollutants, which is intermediate between the two extreme situations: total dispersion (completely mixing) and no dispersion (plug ﬂow). Therefore the water bodies or their reaches can be characterised by a dispersion coefﬁcient. High dispersion coefﬁcients are associated with water bodies approaching a completely mixing regime, whereas reduced coefﬁcients are associated with water bodies approaching plug-ﬂow condi- tions. The dispersed-ﬂow regime is particularly relevant with rivers under estuarine inﬂuence or with very low ﬂow velocities.In the present chapter, the simpliﬁed approach of considering a river to be represented by the plug-ﬂow regime is adopted, which is acceptable for most situations.

In this graph, the vertical axis is the DO concentration and the horizontal axis is the distance or travelling time, along which the biochem- ical transformations take place. From the graph, the following elements can be obtained: • identiﬁcation of the consequences of the discharge • connection of the pollution with the self-puriﬁcation zones • relative importance of the consumption and production of oxygen • critical point of lowest DO concentration • comparison between the critical DO concentration and the minimum al- lowable concentration, according with the legislation • location where the water course returns to the desired conditions The modelling of these items depends essentially on the understanding of the two main interacting mechanisms in the DO balance: deoxygenation and atmo- spheric reaeration. These topics are covered in the following subsections. 3.2.4 Kinetics of deoxygenation 3.2.4.1 Mathematical formulation As already seen, the main ecological effect of organic pollution in a water body is the decrease in the levels of dissolved oxygen. This decrease is associated with the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), described in Chapter 2.

However, the oxygen consumption in the sample varies with time, that is, the BOD value is different each day. The objective of the present section is to mathematically analyse the progress of oxygen consumption with time. The concept of BOD, representing both the organic matter concentration and the oxygen consumption, can be understood by the following two distinct angles, both having as units mass of oxygen per unit volume (e.g. mgO2/L): • remaining BOD: concentration of the organic matter remaining in the liquid mass at a given time • exerted BOD: cumulative oxygen consumption for the stabilisation of the organic matter The progress of BOD with time, according with both concepts, can be seen in Figure 3.6. The two curves are symmetrical, like mirror images. At time zero, the organic matter is present in its total concentration, while the oxygen consumed is zero. With the passing of time, the remaining organic matter reduces, implying an increase in the accumulated oxygen consumption. After a period of several days, the organic matter has been practically all stabilised (remaining BOD close to zero), while the oxygen consumption has been practically all exerted (BOD almost completely exerted). The understanding of this phenomenon is important, because both curves are an integral part of the DO model. The kinetics of the reaction of the remaining organic matter (remaining BOD) follows a ﬁrst-order reaction. A ﬁrst-order reaction is that in which the rate of change of the concentration of a substance is proportional to the ﬁrst power of the concentration. The ﬁrst-order reactions are of fundamental importance in",

The equation of the progress of the remaining BOD with time can be expressed by the following differential equation: dL/dt = −K1.L (3.5) where: L = remaining BOD concentration (mg/L) t = time (day) K1 = deoxygenation coefﬁcient (day−1) The interpretation of Equation 3.5 is that the oxidation rate of the organic matter (dL/dt) is proportional to the organic matter concentration still remaining (L), at any given time t. Therefore, the larger the BOD concentration, the faster is the deoxygenation. After a certain time, in which BOD has been reduced by stabilisation, the reaction rate will be lower, as a result of the lower concentration of organic matter. The deoxygenation coefﬁcient K1 is a parameter of great importance in the modelling of dissolved oxygen, being discussed in the next section. The integration of Equation 3.5, between the limits of L = L0 and t = 0 and t = t, leads to: L = L0.e−K1.t (3.6) where: L = remaining BOD at any given time t (mg/L) L0 = remaining BOD in t = 0 (mg/L) t = time (d) Attention should be given to the fact that, in many references, this equation is written in a decimal form (base 10), and not in base e. Both forms are equivalent, provided the coefﬁcient is expressed in the compatible base (K1 base e = 2.3 × K1 base 10). In the present text, the values of the coefﬁcients are expressed in base e. In terms of oxygen consumption, the quantiﬁcation of the exerted BOD is im- portant. This is obtained through Equation 3.6, leading to: y = L0.(1 −e−K1.t) (3.7) where: y = exerted BOD at a time t (mg/L). Note that y = L0 −L. L0 = remaining BOD, at t = 0 (as deﬁned above), or exerted BOD (when t = ∞).

Treated efﬂuents, for example, have a lower degradation rate due to the fact that the larger part of the easily biodegradable organic matter has already been removed in the treatment plant, leaving only the slowly biodegradable fraction in the efﬂuent. Average values of K1 can be found present in Table 3.3. There are mathematical and statistical processes that can be utilised for the determination of the deoxygenation coefﬁcient, in case there are samples from the water under investigation. The input data for these methods are the values of the exerted BOD at various days, typically days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 or 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. The laboratory tests must include, not only the BOD at 5 days, but also the BOD for all the other days, so that the rate of deoxygenation can be estimated. Nitriﬁcation must be inhibited in the BOD test, especially for the sequence that goes up to nine days. The determination is not trivial, because there are two parameters to be simulta- neously determined: K1 and L0. Non-linear regression analysis can be used, ﬁtting Equation 3.7 to the various pairs of t and BOD to obtain the values of the parame- ters K1and L0. In the present book, it is sufﬁcient to use the values of K1 obtained from the table of typical values (Table 3.3). It should be noted that, especially in the case of shallow rivers receiving untreated sewage, the deoxygenation may be higher than that determined in the laboratory, due to bioﬁlm respiration at the river bottom. Figure 3.7 illustrates the inﬂuence of the value of K1, through the trajectories of the cumulative oxygen consumption of two samples with different values of K1but with the same ultimate demand value (L0 = 100 mg/L). The sample with the higher K1 (0.25 d−1) presents a faster oxygen consumption rate compared with the sample with the lower K1 (0.10 d−1). Values of BOD close to the ultimate demand are reached in less time with the sample with the greater K1.

However, if the progression of BOD is measured through various days, different BOD values can be observed for all the days, with the exception of the ﬁfth day. This is due to the fact that the coefﬁcients of deoxygenation are distinct in the two samples.

For a water course receiving concentrated raw sewage, the typical K₁ value ranges from 0.35 to 0.45 day⁻¹. A water course receiving raw sewage of a low concentration has a typical K₁ value ranging from 0.30 to 0.40 day⁻¹.

The empirical relation between temperature and the deoxygenation coefﬁcient can be expressed in the following form: K₁_T = K₁_20 ⋅ θ^(T-20) where: K₁_T = K₁ at a temperature T (d⁻¹) K₁_20 = K₁ at a temperature T = 20 °C (d⁻¹) T = liquid temperature (°C) θ = temperature coefficient (–) A value usually employed for θ in this reaction is 1.047. The interpretation of this value with relation to Equation 3.8 is that the value of K1 increases 4.7% for every 1 ◦C increment in the temperature of the water. Also to be commented is that changes in the temperature affect K1, but do not alter the value of the ultimate demand L0. 3.2.5 Kinetics of reaeration 3.2.5.1 Mathematical formulation The theory of gas transfer is covered in detail in Chapter 11. In the present chapter only the essential concepts necessary for the understanding of the atmospheric reaeration phenomenon are presented. When water is exposed to a gas, a continuos exchange of molecules occurs between the liquid and gas phases. As soon as the solubility concentration of the gas in the liquid phase is reached, both ﬂows start to be equal in magnitude, such that there is no overall change of the gas concentration in both phases. This dynamic equilibrium deﬁnes the saturation concentration (Cs) of the gas in the liquid phase. However, in case that there is the consumption of dissolved gas in the liquid phase, the main transfer ﬂux is in the gas-liquid direction, in order to re-establish the equilibrium. The atmospheric reaeration process takes place according to this concept. The oxygen consumption in the stabilisation of the organic matter makes the DO concentration to be below the saturation level. As a result, there is a greater ﬂux of atmospheric oxygen to the liquid mass (Figure 3.9). The kinetics of reaeration can also be characterised by a ﬁrst-order reaction (similarly to the deoxygenation), according to the following equation: dD / dt = −K2.D (3.9)",

These methods are based on regression analysis, using either the original Equation 3.10, or some logarithmic transformation of it. The input data are the DO values at various times t. The output data are the sat- uration concentration Cs and the coefﬁcient K2. In a water body, however, the experimental determination of K2 is very complex, being outside the scope of the present text. The value of the coefﬁcient K2 has a larger inﬂuence on the results of the DO balance than the coefﬁcient K1, because of the fact that the ranges of variation of K1 are narrower. There are three methods for estimating the value of the coefﬁcient K2 in the river under study: • average tabulated values • values as a function of the hydraulic characteristics of the water body • values correlated with the ﬂow of the water body a) Average tabulated values of K2 Some researchers, studying water bodies with different characteristics, proposed average values for K2 based on a qualitative description of the water body (Table 3.4). Shallower and faster water bodies tend to have a larger reaeration coefﬁcient, due, respectively, to the greater ease in mixing along the depth and the creation of more turbulence on the surface (see Figure 3.11). The values in Table 3.4 can be used in the absence of speciﬁc data from the water body. It must be taken into consideration that the values from this table are usually lower than those obtained by the other methods discussed below. However, there are indications that, in some situations, the tabulated values result in better ﬁtting to measured DO data than those obtained from hydraulic formula. b) K2 values as a function of the hydraulic characteristics of the water body Other researchers correlated the reaeration coefﬁcient K2 with the hydraulic vari- ables of the water body.

The structure of the model proposed by them (known as the Streeter–Phelps model) is clas- sical within environmental engineering, setting the basis for all the other more sophisticated models that succeeded it. For the relatively simple situation in which only the deoxygenation and the atmospheric reaeration are taken into account in the DO balance, the rate of change of the oxygen deﬁcit with time can be ex- pressed by the following differential equation, originated from the interaction of the deoxygenation and reaeration equations previously seen: Rate of change of the DO deﬁcit = DO consumption −DO production (3.14)",

This indicates that, from the mixing point, the dissolved oxygen concentration tends to increase. The initial deﬁcit is the largest observed deﬁcit. In terms of DO, the water course presents a self- puriﬁcation capacity that is higher than the degeneration capacity of the wastewater. In practical terms, the critical time can be considered equal to zero, with the occurrence of the lowest DO values at the mixing point. • K2/K1 = 1 The application of the critical time formula leads to a mathematical inde- termination.

Such procedure involves some iterations because, for each alteration of the maximum permissible load, there is a modiﬁcation of the critical time. However, in a real situation, with more than one discharge point, this approach becomes not very practical. What is usually done its to consider BOD removal efﬁciencies which are compatible with the existing or available wastewater treatment processes, and to recalculate the DO proﬁle for each new condition. The most economic situation is usually that in which the minimum DO concentration is only marginally higher than the minimum permitted by legislation.",

Therefore it is necessary to obtain the most precise ﬂow value, whenever possible. The use of the DO model can be with any of the following ﬂows, depending on the objectives: • ﬂow observed in a certain period • mean ﬂow (annual average, average in the rainy season, average in the dry season) • minimum ﬂow The observed ﬂow in a certain period is used for model calibration (adjusting the model coefﬁcients), so that the simulated data are as close as possible to the observed (measured) data in the water body during the period under analysis. The mean ﬂow is adopted when the simulation of the average prevailing condi- tions is desired, such as during the year, rainy months or dry months.

The minimum ﬂow is utilised for the planning of catchment areas, the evaluation of the compliance with environmental standards of the water body and for the allo- cation of pollutant loads. Therefore, the determination of the required efﬁciencies for the treatment of various discharges must be determined in the critical condi- tions. These critical conditions in the receiving body occur exactly in the minimum ﬂow period, when the dilution capacity is lower. The critical ﬂow must be calculated from the historical ﬂow measurement data from the water course. The analysis of methods to estimate minimum ﬂows is outside the scope of the present text, being well covered in hydrology books. Usually a minimum ﬂow with a return period of 10 years and a duration of the minimum of 7 days (Q7,10), is adopted. This can be understood as a value that may repeat itself in a probability of every 10 years, consisting of the lowest average obtained in 7 consecutive days. Therefore, in each year of the historical data series the 365 average daily ﬂows are analysed. In each year a period of 7 days is selected, which resulted in the lowest average ﬂow (average of 7 values). With the values of the lowest 7-day average for every year, an statistical analysis is undertaken, allowing interpolation or extrapolation of the value for a return period of 10 years. Adoption of the 10-year return period in the Q7,10 concept leads to small ﬂows and frequently to the requirement of high BOD removal efﬁciencies, the cost of which should always be borne in mind, especially in developing countries. For these countries, probably a shorter return period would be more realistic, especially considering that the current condition is probably already of a polluted river. Another approach is the utilisation of percentiles, such as a 90%ile value (Q90). In this concept, 90% of the ﬂow values are greater than the critical ﬂow, and only 10% are lower than it. This approach usually leads to critical ﬂows that are greater than those based on Q7,10. Underanyﬂowconditions,theutilisationoftheconceptofthe speciﬁcdischarge (L/s.km2) is helpful. Knowing the drainage area at the discharge point and adopting a value for the speciﬁc discharge, the product of both leads to the ﬂow of the water course. The speciﬁc discharge values can vary greatly from region to region, as a function of climate, topography, soil, etc., For Q7,10 conditions, the following ranges are typical: (a) arid regions: probably less than 1,0 L/s.km2; (b) regions with good water resources availability: maybe higher than 3,0 L/s.km2; and (c) in intermediate regions: values close to 2.0 L/s.km2. b) Wastewater",

Ideally, historical data should be used in this analysis. When doing so, coherence is required: if the simulation is for a dry period, only samples pertaining to the dry period should be considered. In case that it is not possible to collect water samples at this point, the DO concentration can be estimated as a function of the approximate pollution level of the water body. If there are few indications of pollution, a DOr value of 80% to 90% of the oxygen saturation value (see item k below) can be adopted. In the event that the water body is already well polluted upstream of the dis- charge, a sampling campaign is justiﬁed, or even an upstream extension of the boundaries of the studies should be considered, in order to include the main pollut- ing points. In such a situation, the value of DOr will be well below the saturation level. d) Dissolved oxygen in the wastewater (DOw) In sewage, the dissolved oxygen levels are normally nihil or close to zero. This is due to the large quantity of organic matter present, implying a high consumption of oxygen by the microorganisms. Therefore the DO of raw sewage is usually adopted as zero in the calculations. In case that the wastewater is treated, the following considerations could be made: • Primary treatment. Primary efﬂuents can be assumed as having DO equal to zero. • Anaerobic treatment. Anaerobic efﬂuents also have DO equal to zero. • Activatedsludgeandbioﬁlmreactors.Efﬂuentsfromthesesystemsundergo a certain aeration at the efﬂuent weir on the secondary sedimentation tanks, enabling DO to increase to 2 mg/L or slightly more. If the discharge outfall is long, this oxygen could be consumed as a result of the remaining BOD from the treatment. • Facultative or maturation ponds. Efﬂuents from facultative or maturation ponds can have during day time DO levels close to saturation, or even higher, due to the production of pure oxygen by the algae. At night the DO levels decrease. For the purpose of the calculations, DOw values around 4 to 6 mg/L can be adopted. • Efﬂuents subjected to ﬁnal reaeration.

Gravity aeration should not be used directly for anaerobic efﬂuents, due to the release of H2S in the gas-transfer operation. Section 11.10 presents the methodology for calculating the increase in DO. Table 3.6 presents BOD₅ values of a river as a function of the water body characteristics, with the data sourced from Klein (1962). According to the table, a Very clean river condition corresponds to a BOD₅ of 1 mg/L, a Clean condition corresponds to a BOD₅ of 2 mg/L, a Reasonably clean condition has a BOD₅ of 3 mg/L, a Doubtful condition has a BOD₅ of 5 mg/L, and a Bad river condition is indicated by a BOD₅ of greater than 10 mg/L. e) BOD5 in the river, upstream of discharge (BODr) BOD5 in the river, upstream of the discharge, is a function of the wastewater discharges (point or diffuse sources) along the river down to the mixing point. The same considerations made for DOr about sampling campaigns and the inclusion of upstream polluting points are also valid here. Klein (1962) proposed the classiﬁcation presented in Table 3.6, in the absence of speciﬁc data. f) BOD5 in the wastewater (BODw) The BOD5 concentration in raw domestic sewage has an average value in the order of 300 mg/L. The BOD can also be estimated through the quotient between the BOD load (calculated from the population and the per capita BOD contribution) and the wastewater ﬂow (domestic sewage + inﬁltration). For more details, see Section 2.2.5. In case there are industrial discharges of importance, particularly from agro- industries and others with high content of organic matter in the efﬂuent, they must be included in the calculation. These values can be obtained by sampling or through literature data. See Section 2.2.6. For a treated wastewater, of course the BOD removal efﬁciency must be taken into account, since treatment is the main environmental control measure to be adopted. In this case, the BOD5 in the wastewater is: BODtw = (1 −E / 100 )·BODrw (3.28) where: BODtw = BOD5 of the treated wastewater (mg/L) BODrw = BOD5 of the raw wastewater (mg/L) E = BOD5 removal efﬁciency of the treatment (%) Table 4.9 presents typical ranges of BOD removal efﬁciency from various wastewater treatment systems.

An overview of these systems can be found in Chapter 4. Various other chapters of this book are dedicated to the detailed de- scription of these systems. g) Deoxygenation coefﬁcient (K1) The deoxygenation coefﬁcient can be obtained following the criteria presented in Section 3.2.4.2. It must be noted that water bodies that receive biologically treated wastewater have a lower value of K1 (see Table 3.3). For liquid temperatures different from 20 ◦C, the value of K1 must be corrected (seer Section 3.2.4.3). h) Reaeration coefﬁcient (K2) The reaeration coefﬁcient can be obtained following the procedures outlined in Section 3.2.5.2. For liquid temperatures different from 20 ◦C, the value of K2 must be corrected (see Section 3.2.5.3). i) Velocity of the water body (v) The velocity of the liquid mass in the water course may be estimated using the following methods: • direct measurement in the water course • data obtained from ﬂow-measuring points • use of hydraulic formulas for open channels • correlation with ﬂow In DO simulations that can be done under any ﬂow conditions, obtaining the velocity through the last two methods is more convenient. In other words, it is important that the velocity is coherent with the ﬂow under consideration, since in dry periods the velocities are usually lower, with the opposite occurring in wet periods. The hydraulic formulas are presented in pertinent literature. The most adequate friction factor should be chosen as a function of the river bed characteristics (see Chow, 1959). The ﬂow-correlation method should follow a methodology similar to the one described in Item 3.2.5.2c for the reaeration coefﬁcient. The model to be obtained can have the form v = cQd, where c and d are coefﬁcients obtained from regression analysis. j) Travel time (t) In the Streeter–Phelps model, the theoretical travel time that a particle takes to complete a certain river reach is a function of the velocity and the distance. This is because the model assumes a plug-ﬂow regime and does not consider the effects of dispersion. Therefore, knowing the distances and having determined the velocities in each reach, the residence time is obtained directly from the relation: t = d / v · 86,400 (3.29)",

The value of Cs is a function of water temperature and altitude: • The increase in temperature reduces the saturation concentration (the greater agitation of molecules in the water tends to make the dissolved gases pass to the gas phase) • The increase in altitude reduces the saturation concentration (the atmo- spheric pressure is lower, thus exerting a lower pressure for the gas to be dissolved in the water). There are some empirical formulas in the literature (the majority based on regression analysis) that directly supply the value of Cs (mg/L) as a function of, for example, the temperature T (◦C). A formula frequently employed is (P¨opel, 1979): Cs = 14.652 −4.1022 × 10−1.T + 7.9910 × 10−3.T2 −7.7774 × 10−5.T3 (3.30) The inﬂuence of the altitude can be computed by the following relation (Qasim, 1985): fH = Cs′ / Cs = (1 −Altitude / 9450 ) (3.31) where: fH = correction factor for altitude, for the DO saturation concentra- tion (−) C′ s = DO saturation concentration at the altitude H (mg/L) Altitude = altitude (m above sea level) Salinity also affects the solubility of oxygen.

Among the main control measures, there are: • wastewater treatment • ﬂow regularisation in the water body • aeration of the water body • aeration of the treated wastewater • allocation of other uses for the water body a) Wastewater treatment Individual or collective sewage treatment before discharge is usually the main and often the only control strategy. However, its possible combination with some of the other presented strategies should be analysed, aiming at obtaining a technically favourable solution at the lowest cost. Wastewater treatment is the main alternative analysed in the present book. b) Flow regularisation of the water body This alternative generally consists of building an upstream dam, in order to aug- ment the low ﬂow under critical conditions. The most attractive option is to include multiple uses for the dam, such as irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, recre- ation, water supply and others. Another positive aspect is that the efﬂuent from the dams can contain higher levels of dissolved oxygen because of the aeration at the efﬂuent weir. It must be remembered that the implementation of dams is a delicate topic from an environmental point of view. Also, if the upstream catchment area is not properly protected, the reservoir can become a point of localised pollution and risks of eutrophication. c) Aeration of the water body Another possibility is to provide aeration in the water body at a point down- stream of the discharge, maintaining the DO concentrations above the minimum allowable. An advantage of this alternative resides in the fact that the assimilative capacity of the water course can be totally used in periods of high ﬂow and the aeration can be limited to dry periods only. This is a form of collective treatment and involves the distribution of the costs between the various beneﬁciaries. The following aeration methods can be employed: • diffused-air aeration • surface (mechanical) aeration • aeration at weirs • turbine aeration • injection by pressure Besides this, natural waterfalls can contribute signiﬁcantly to the DO increase (see Section 3.2.5.2, equations 3.11 and 3.12). d) Aeration of the treated wastewater At the efﬂuent weir of the WWTP, after satisfaction of the oxygen demand, the efﬂuent can suffer a simple aeration, usually by means of weirs.

In anaerobic efﬂuents, however, aeration must be avoided because it causes the release of hydrogen sulphide, which causes problems of bad odours. e) Allocation of other uses for the water body In case it is not possible (mainly for economic reasons) to control the polluting dis- charges in order to preserve the water quality as a function of the intended uses of the water body, these uses could be re-evaluated in the river or in selected reaches. Therefore, it could be necessary to attribute less noble uses for a certain reach of the river, due to the unfeasibility of implementing the control measure at the desired level. The allocation of uses for the water body should be carried out in such a way as to optimise regional water resources, aiming at their various uses (Arceivala, 1981).",

This topic, including the main pathogens of interest and the concept of indicator organisms of faecal contamina- tion, is discussed in Chapter 2. A water body receiving the discharge of sewage may incorporate into itself a wide range of pathogenic organisms. This fact may not generate a direct impact on the aquatic organisms themselves, but may affect some of prevailing uses of the water, such as potable water supply, irrigation and bathing. Therefore, it is very important to know the behaviour of the pathogenic organ- isms in the water body, starting from the discharge point until places where water is likely to be used. It is known that most of these agents have optimal conditions for their growth and reproduction in the human intestinal tract. Once submitted to the adverse conditions that prevail in the water body, they tend to decrease in number, characterising the so-called decay. In Chapter 2 it was seen that the bacteria of the coliform group are used as indicators of faecal contamination; that is, they indicate if the water has been con- taminated by faeces and, as a result, if it presents a potential for having pathogens",

The physical factors include solar light, specifically ultraviolet radiation, temperature, noting that values in water are usually lower than those in human bodies, along with adsorption, flocculation, and sedimentation. Physical-chemical factors contributing to bacterial decay are osmotic effects, also referred to as salinity, pH, chemical toxicity, and redox potential. Finally, the biological and biochemical factors involved in bacterial decay are the lack of nutrients, predation, and competition. and therefore transmitting diseases. The present item covers the qualitative and quantitative relations associated with the decay of the coliforms in water bodies. It is assumed that this decay represents, with a certain safety, an indication of the behaviour of the pathogens (especially bacteria) discharged into the water body. 3.3.2 Bacterial decay kinetics 3.3.2.1 Intervening factors Coliforms and other microorganisms of intestinal origin present a natural mortality when exposed to environmental conditions that are different from the previously preponderant conditions inside the human system, which were ideal for their de- velopment and reproduction. Table 3.8 lists important factors that contribute to the bacterial decay in water bodies (Arceivala, 1981; EPA, 1985; Thomann and Mueller, 1987). These factors may act simultaneously and with different degrees of importance. 3.3.2.2 Kinetics of bacterial decay The bacterial mortality rate is generally estimated by Chick’s law, according to which, the higher the concentration of bacteria, the higher is the decay rate (ﬁrst- order reaction): dN / dt = −Kb.N (3.33) where: N = number of coliforms (organisms /100 ml) Kb = coefﬁcient of bacterial decay (d−1) t = time (d)",

Rivers are usually represented as plug-ﬂow reactors, while reservoirs are frequently represented as completely-mixed reactors. Depending on the characteristics of the water body, the formulas shown in Table 3 can be used. For completely-mixed reactors, the time t corresponds to the detention time, given by: t = V/Q. The concentration of the coliforms at any point in the reactor is the same, coinciding with the efﬂuent concentration. 3.3.2.3 Bacterial decay coefﬁcient Values of Kb obtained in various studies in fresh water vary within a wide range. Typical values, however, are close to (Arceivala, 1981; EPA, 1985; Thomann and Mueller, 1987): Kb = 0.5 to 1.5 d−1 (base e, 20 ◦C) Typical value ≈1.0 d−1 The effect of temperature on the decay coefﬁcient can be formulated as: KbT = Kb20.θ(T−20) (3.34) where: θ = temperature coefﬁcient (−) A typical value for θ can be 1.07 (Castagnino, 1977; Thomann and Mueller, 1987), though there is a great variation in the data presented in the literature. Table 3.10 outlines the main processes for the removal of pathogenic organisms in wastewater treatment, dividing them into two types: Natural and Artificial. Under the Natural type, the processes listed are Maturation ponds and Land infiltration. The Artificial type includes the processes of Chlorination, Ozonisation, Ultraviolet radiation, and Membranes. A note specifies that for a description of the process, one should see Chapter 4.",

    "text_to_embed": "3.3.3 Control of the contamination by pathogenic organisms The best measure to control contamination of a water body by pathogenic or- ganisms from sewage is through their removal at the wastewater treatment stage. However, this approach is not practised throughout the world. In various countries there is systematic disinfection of the sewage treatment efﬂuent, while in others disinfection is only carried out in the potable water treatment. However, in any case, approaches that preserve the deﬁned uses of the water body should be adopted. The wastewater treatment processes usually applied are very efﬁcient in the removal of suspended solids and organic matter, but generally insufﬁcient for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms. In spite of the great importance of this item in developing countries, it has not yet received due consideration. Table 4.9 in Chapter 4 lists the coliform removal efﬁciencies obtained in the main wastewater treatment systems. It should be always remembered that the coliforms are not a direct indication of the presence of pathogens, and they may represent only those organisms that have similar decay (or removal) mechanisms and similar (or higher) mortality rates. Protozoan cysts and helminth eggs are removed by different mechanisms (e.g. sedimentation) and are not well represented by coliforms. Even though removal efﬁciencies of 90% shown in Table 4.9 may seem high, it should be borne in mind that, when dealing with coliforms, much higher efﬁ- ciencies are generally necessary in order to have low concentrations in the water body, as a result of the very high concentrations in the raw sewage. High coliform removal efﬁciencies can be obtained by the processes listed in Table 3.10, which are further detailed in Chapter 4. The processes listed above are capable of reaching coliform removal efﬁciencies of 99.99% or more. Frequently the coliform removal efﬁciency is expressed in a logarithmic scale.",

For instance, a coliform concentration, which is reduced from 107 organisms/ 100 ml to 104 organisms/100 ml, is reduced in 3 orders of magnitude, or 99.9%. If the logarithms of the concentrations are calculated, the reduction is from 7 to 4 units, in other words, 3 log units. Coliform concentrations are frequently represented in terms of the order of magnitude (powers of 10) or in their logarithms, considering their great variability and the uncertainty in more precise numerical values, and because coliform data usually tend to follow a log-normal distribution. The following formulas relate the efﬁciency expressed as percentage removal with log units removed. Efﬁciency (%) = (N0 −N)/N0 = 100 × (1 −10−log.units removed) (3.35) Log units removed = −log10[1 −(Efﬁciency (%)/100)] (3.36) Not all countries or regions have coliform standards for the water body.

As discussed in this chapter, the main stimulating factor is an excessive level of nutrients in the water body, principally nitrogen and phosphorus. In this chapter, the water bodies under consideration are lakes and reservoirs. The process of eutrophication can also occur in rivers, though this is less frequent, owing to the environmental conditions being less favourable for the growth of algae and other plants, because of factors such as turbidity and high velocities. The following description illustrates the possible sequence of the eutrophication process in a water body, such as a lake or reservoir (see Figure 3.16). The level of eutrophication is usually associated with the predominant land use and occupation in the catchment area. a) Occupation by woods and forests A lake situated in a catchment area occupied by woods and forests usually presents a low productivity; that is to say, there is little biological activity of production (synthesis) in it.

Even in these natural conditions and in the absence of human interference, the lake tends to accumulate solids that settle, which form a layer of sludge at the bottom. With the decomposition of the settled material, there is a certain increase, still incipient, of the level of nutrients in the liquid mass. As a result, there is a progressive increase in the population of aquatic plants and, in consequence, of the other organisms situated at a higher level in the food chain. In the catchment area, the larger part of the nutrients is retained within a nearly closed cycle. The plants die and, in the soil, are decomposed, releasing nutrients. In a region of woods and forests, the inﬁltration capacity of the rainwater into the soil is high. The nutrients then percolate into the soil, where they are absorbed by the roots of the plants, making part again of their composition and closing the cycle. The input of nutrients to the water body is small. The water body still presents a low trophic level. b) Agricultural occupation The removal of natural vegetation from the catchment area for agricultural use generally leads to an intermediate stage in the deterioration process of the water body. The crops planted in the basin are harvested and transported for human consumption, probably outside the catchment area. With this, there is a removal of nutrients that is not naturally compensated, causing a break in the internal cycle. To compensate this removal and to make the agriculture more intensive, fertilisers containing high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus are added artiﬁcially. The farmers aim at guaranteeing a high production and thus add high quantities of N and P, frequently greater than the assimilative capacity of the plants. The substitution of woods by plants for agricultural purposes can also cause a reduction in the inﬁltration capacity of the soil. Therefore the nutrients, already added in excess, are less retained and run off the soil until they eventually reach a lake or reservoir. The increase in the nutrient level in the water body causes a certain increase in the number of algae and, in consequence, of the other organisms located at higher levels in the food chain, culminating with the ﬁsh. This relative increase in the productivity of the water body can even be welcome, depending on its intended uses, as would be the case, for instance, in aquaculture. The balance between the",

The implementation of housing developments implies land move- ment for the works. Urbanisation also reduces the water inﬁltration capac- ity into the soil.

The sedimentation of the soil particles causes silting and reduces the net volume of the water body. The settled material also serves as a support medium for the growth of rooted plants of larger dimensions (macrophytes) near the shores. In spite of some ecological advantages (e.g. physical re- tention of pollutants, reduction of sediment resuspension, refuge for ﬁshes and macroinvertebrates), these plants cause an evident deterioration in the visual aspect of the water body. • Urban stormwater drainage. Urban drainage transports a far greater load of nutrients in comparison with the other types of occupation of the catchment area. This nutrient input contributes to a rise in the level of algae in the reservoir. • Sewage. The greatest deterioration factor, however, is associated with wastewater originating from urban activities. The wastewater contains ni- trogen and phosphorus present in faeces and urine, food remains, deter- gents and other by-products of human activity. The N and P contribution from sewage is much higher than the contribution originating from urban drainage. Therefore, there is a great increase in the input of N and P onto the lake or reservoir, bringing as a result an elevation in the population of algae and other plants. Depending on the assimilative capacity of the water body, the algal popu- lation can reach very high values, bringing about a series of problems, which are described in the subsequent item. In a period with high sunshine (light energy for photosynthesis), the algae can reach superpopulations and be present at massive concentrations at the surface layer. This surface layer hinders the penetration of light energy for the lower layers in the water body, causing the death of algae situated in these regions. The death of these algae brings in itself a series of other problems. These events of superpopulation of algae are called algal blooms. 3.4.2 Problems of eutrophication The following are the main undesired effects of eutrophication (Arceivala, 1981; Thomann and Mueller, 1987; von Sperling, 1994): • Recreational and aesthetic problems. Reduction of the use of water for recreation, bathing and as a general tourist attraction because of the: • frequent algal blooms • excessive vegetation growth • disturbances with mosquitoes and insects • occasional bad odours • occasional ﬁsh mortality • Anaerobic conditions in the bottom of the water body.

With the anaerobiosis, reducing conditions prevail, leading to compounds and elements being present in a reduced state: • iron and manganese are found in a soluble form, which may bring problems with the water supply; • phosphate is also found in a soluble form, and may represent an internal source of phosphorus for algae; • hydrogen sulphide may also causes problems of toxicity and bad odours. • Occasional anaerobic conditions in the water body as a whole. Depending on the degree of bacterial growth, during periods of total mixing of the liquid mass (thermal inversion) or in the absence of photosynthesis (night time), ﬁsh mortality and the reintroduction of reduced compounds from the bottom onto the whole liquid mass could occur, leading to a large deterioration in the water quality. • Occasional ﬁsh mortality. Fish mortality could occur as a result of: • anaerobiosis (mentioned above) • ammoniatoxicity.UnderconditionsofhighpH(frequentduringperiods of high photosynthetic activity), ammonia may be present in signiﬁcant amounts in its free form (NH3), toxic for the ﬁsh, instead of the ionised form (NH + 4 ), which is non-toxic. • Greater difﬁculty and increase in the costs of water treatment. The exces- sive presence of algae substantially affects the treatment of water abstracted from a lake or reservoir, due to the necessity of: • removal of the algae themselves • colour removal • taste and odour removal • higher consumption of chemical products • more frequent ﬁlter backwashings • Problems with industrial water supply. Elevation in the costs of industrial water supply due to reasons similar to those already mentioned, and also to the presence of algae deposits in cooling waters. • Water toxicity.

In a simpliﬁed way, there are the following trophic levels: • oligotrophic (clear lakes with a low productivity) • mesotrophic (lakes with an intermediate productivity) • eutrophic (lakes with a high productivity, compared with the natural basic level) This classiﬁcation can be further detailed, with the inclusion of other trophic levels, such as: ultraoligotrophic, oligotrophic, oligomesotrophic, mesotrophic, mesoeutrophic, eutrophic, eupolitrophic and hypereutrophic (from lowest to high- est productivity). A qualitative classiﬁcation between the main trophic levels may be as presented in Table 3.11. The quantiﬁcation of the trophic level is, however, more difﬁcult, especially for tropical lakes. Von Sperling (1994) presents a collection of various references, in terms of total phosphorus concentration, chlorophyll a and transparency, which shows the large amplitude in the ranges proposed by various authors. Besides this, the cited reference presents other possible indices to be used, always with the safeguard of the difﬁculty in generalising the data from one water body to another. It should be kept in mind that tropical water bodies present a larger capacity of phosphorus assimilation in comparison with water bodies in temperate climates. An interpretation of the synthesis reported by von Sperling may be as presented in Table 3.12 in terms of the total phosphorus concentration. The establishment of the trophic levels based only on phosphorus is due to a mathematical modelling convenience. In the same way that in the other water pollution topics covered in the book, representative variables, such as dissolved oxygen (pollution by organic matter) and coliforms (contamination by pathogens), Table 3.12 provides the approximate range of values for total phosphorus concentration in the reservoir in mgP/m³ for the main trophic levels, based on data presented by von Sperling (1994). For the Ultraoligotrophic level, the total phosphorus concentration is less than 5 mgP/m³. The Oligotrophic level has a range of less than 10–20 mgP/m³. The Mesotrophic level shows a range of 10–50 mgP/m³. The Eutrophic level is associated with a range of 25–100 mgP/m³. Finally, the Hypereutrophic level indicates a total phosphorus concentration greater than 100 mgP/m³. A note explains that the overlapping of values between two ranges indicates the difficulty in establishing rigid ranges for these trophic levels.",

In the same way that in the other water pollution topics covered in the book, representative variables, such as dissolved oxygen (pollution by organic matter) and coliforms (contamination by pathogens), phosphorus is adopted as a representative of the trophic level in this chapter. However, as seen in Section 3.4.5, there are some situations in which nitrogen controls the eutrophication process. The researcher should always be open to include other variables in the anal- ysis, in order to get a picture as close as possible to the actual behaviour of the water body under study. Von Sperling et al (2002), analysing data from more than 1,500 lakes and reservoirs around the world, investigated the correlation between morphometric variables and trophic level (using a subset of 269 water bodies, which had information on trophic level). From the statistical analysis it was clear that depth (mean depth, maximum depth and relative depth) is the morphomet- ric variable most closely related with the trophic status: the shallower the water body, the greater the tendency for having a higher trophic level, mainly because of a higher light penetration over the full water body. Figure 3.17 shows a re- sulting box-and-whisker plot for the mean depth, where this association is clearly seen. The association between trophic levels and water uses is shown in Table 3.13. 3.4.4 Dynamics of lakes and reservoirs The vertical temperature proﬁle in lakes and reservoirs varies with the seasons of the year. This temperature variation affects the density of the water and as a result the mixing and stratiﬁcation capacity of the water body. During warm periods, the temperature at the surface layer is much higher than the temperature at the bottom, because of solar radiation. Owing to this fact, the density of the water at the surface is lower than the density of the bottom layer,",

Owing to this fact, the density of the water at the surface is lower than the density of the bottom layer, which causes the existence of distinct layers in the water body: • epilimnion: upper, warmer, less dense, with higher circulation • thermocline: transition layer • hypolimnion: bottom layer, colder, denser, with greater stagnation The difference in densities can be such as to cause a complete stratiﬁcation in the water body, with the three layers not mixing with each other. This stratiﬁcation has a great inﬂuence on the water quality. Depending on the trophic level of the water body, a complete absence of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion can occur. As a result, in this layer there will be a predominance of iron, manganese and other compounds in their reduced forms. With the arrival of a cold period, the upper layer in the lake cools, causing a certain homogenisation in the temperature along the depth. With the homogeni- sation of the temperature, there is a greater similarity in the water densities. The upper layer, suddenly cooled, tends to go to the bottom of the lake, dislodging the bottom layer and causing a complete turn over in the lake. This phenomenon is called thermal inversion or turn over. In lakes that present a high concentration of reduced compounds in the hypolimnion, the reintroduction of these compounds into the whole liquid mass of the lake can cause a large deterioration in the water quality. The decrease in dissolved oxygen due to the reintroduced demand by the reduced organic and inorganic compounds, together with the resuspension of the anaerobic bottom layer, can cause ﬁsh mortality.

Figure 3.18 presents typical temperature and DO proﬁles under conditions of stratiﬁcation and turn over. Lakes and reservoirs may present different mixing patterns and frequencies (von Sperling, 1999; Dantas, 2000): a) Holomictic lakes. Complete circulation over the whole water column. De- pending on the number of circulations per year, they can be classiﬁed as: • Monomictic. One circulation per year. Usually located where there are clear seasonal variations. Two types: – Warm monomictic. One circulation in winter. Located in tem- perate regions, high-altitude subtropical regions and in tropical regions. – Cold monomictic. One circulation in summer. Located in subpolar regions and high-altitude regions in temperate climates. • Dimictic. Two circulations per year, one in spring, one in autumn. Located in temperate climates. Warm months: stratiﬁcation; autumn: cooling of upper layer and mixing. Cold months: ice cover; spring: ice melting, wind-induced mixing. • Oligomictic. Few circulations per year. Usually deep lakes in wet trop- ics, where there is little seasonal variation. Warm water along the water column. • Polimictic. Many circulations per year. Usually shallow lakes with daily circulations, unprotected from wind action, and located in warmer regions. Inﬂuence from daily temperature variations. Day hours: strat- iﬁcation. Night hours: cooling of upper layer and mixing. b) Meromictic lakes. Circulation does not occur at the whole water column. Bottom layer (monimolimnion): stagnated due to high concentration of dissolved substances. Little inﬂuence from temperature. c) Amictic lakes. No circulation. Usually ice-covered lakes at very high alti- tudes in equatorial regions or high latitudes. For warm regions (the main focus of this book), the prevailing mixing patterns are either warm monomictic or polimictic. The variables that most signiﬁcantly affect the mixing pattern are those related with depth (mean depth, maximum depth, relative depth) (von Sperling et al, 2002). 3.4.5 Limiting nutrient The limiting nutrient is the one that, being essential for a certain population, limits its growth. According to Liebig’s law, a limiting nutrient is the one whose concentration is closest to the minimum related to the organism’s demand. With low concentrations of the limiting nutrient, the population growth is low. With an increase in the limiting nutrient concentration, the population growth also in- creases. This situation persists until the point in which the concentration of this nutrient starts to be so high in the system, that another nutrient starts to be the new limiting factor, since it is not present at concentrations sufﬁciently high for the requirements of the large",

This nutrient is now the new limiting nutri- ent, because there is no impact in increasing the concentration of the ﬁrst nutrient, since the population will not rise, because it will be limited by the insufﬁciency of the new limiting nutrient. Thomann and Mueller (1987) suggested the following criterion, based on the ratio between the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations (N/P), in order to make a preliminary estimate of whether the algal growth is being controlled by phosphorus or nitrogen. • large lakes, with a predominance of diffuse sources: N/P >> 10: limited by phosphorus • small lakes, with a predominance of point sources: N/P << 10: limited by nitrogen According to Salas and Martino (1991), most of the tropical lakes in Latin America are limited by phosphorus. Another aspect is that, even if the external in- put of nitrogen is controlled, there are organisms (cyanobacteria) which are capable of ﬁxing atmospheric nitrogen. These organisms would be not reduced in numbers with the decrease in the inﬂuent load of nitrogen. Because of this, usually a larger priority is given to the control of the phosphorus sources when the eutrophication of a lake or reservoir needs to be controlled. The present text follows this approach. 3.4.6 Estimation of the phosphorus load into a lake or reservoir The main sources of phosphorus to a lake or reservoir are, in increasing order of importance: • Stormwater drainage • Areas with woods and forests • Agricultural areas • Urban areas • Wastewater Stormwater drainage from areas with ample vegetation coverage, such as woods and forests, transports a lower quantity of phosphorus. In these areas, phosphorus is not in excess in the environment, since the ecosystem is close to an equilibrium, without having large excesses or scarcities of the main elements. Drainage from agricultural areas leads to higher and more variable P loads, depending on the soil retention capacity, irrigation, type of fertilisers and climatic conditions. Urban drainage is associated with the highest loads. Domestic sewage trans- ported by waterborne sewerage systems is usually the greatest source of phospho- rus. Phosphorus can be found in human wastes, household detergents and other by-products of human activities. Regarding industrial wastewater, the generalisa- tion of its contribution is difﬁcult because of the variability of the various industrial wastewaters, even within the same industrial processing activity.",

For Drainage as a source, Areas of woods and forests show a typical value of 10 kgP/km².year, Agricultural areas contribute a typical value of 50 kgP/km².year, and Urban areas have a typical value of 100 kgP/km².year, all measured per square kilometer per year. Domestic sewage, as a source of Domestic type, has a typical value of 0.5 kgP/inhab.year, indicating kilograms of phosphorus per inhabitant per year. A note clarifies that these values may vary widely from place to place and are presented only as references of orders of magnitude.Table 3.14 presents typical values of the unit phosphorus contribution, compiled from various references (von Sperling, 1985). The unit of time adopted is “year”, convenient for modelling of P in lakes. Naturally the values can vary widely, from place to place. However, the values presented aim only to show an order of magnitude of the typical values. 3.4.7 Estimation of the phosphorus concentration in the water body Literature presents a series of simpliﬁed empirical models to estimate the phos- phorus concentration in a water body, as a function of inﬂuent load, detention time and geometric characteristics. The empirical models can be applied in any of the following applications: • Estimation of the trophic level. Once the phosphorus concentration in the water body has been estimated, the trophic level of the lake can be evaluated, based on the considerations of Section 3.4.3. • Estimation of the maximum allowable load. The maximum allowable P load into the lake can be estimated, such that the resulting P concentration is lower than a maximum desired value (e.g. a concentration that characterises eutrophic conditions). The empirical approach has been more applied for planning than conceptual and more sophisticated models, because of the difﬁculty in structuring and obtaining the coefﬁcients and input data necessary for these models. The most widely known empirical model is that proposed by Vollenweider (1976), which has been developed, however, for temperate climatic conditions. The model, presented in a convenient form for the present text, is: P = L.103 / V (1 t + Ks) (3.37) where: P = phosphorus concentration in the water body (gP/m3) L = inﬂuent phosphorus load (kgP/year)",

The obtained value was: Ks = 1/ √ t (3.38) Castagnino (1982), theoretically analysing the P loss by sedimentation in tropical lakes, found a value of Ks equal to 2.5 times the value of Vollenweider. This magnifying factor of 2.5 is composed by a factor of 1.3 for the faster sedimentation at higher temperatures and a factor of 1.9 for the faster phytoplankton growth rate (1.3 × 1.9 = 2.5). According to Castagnino, the corrected Ks value for tropical conditions is: Ks = 2.5/ √ t (3.39) SalasandMartino(1991),analysingexperimentaldatafrom40lakesandreservoirs in Latin America and the Caribbean obtained, by regression analysis, the following relation for Ks: Ks = 2/ √ t (3.40) With the values obtained by Salas and Martino (1991), the P concentration in the reservoir becomes: P concentration in the reservoir: P = L.103 V. 1 t + 2 √ t (3.41) Equation 3.41 can be arranged to lead to the maximum allowable P load into a lake or reservoir, so as not to surpass a maximum desired phosphorus concentration in the water body.

From Table 3.12, the P concentration range in an eutrophic water body is 25 to 100 mgP/m3or 0.025 to 0.100 gP/m3. The establishment of a more relaxed or restrictive value for P must be done for each case, analysing the multiple uses of the reservoir and its level of importance. Because of the fact that it was developed based on tropical water bodies, the em- pirical model proposed by Salas and Martino (1991) is probably the most adequate to be used for planning and management of lakes and reservoirs in warm-climate regions. Naturally, the critical view and experience of the researcher must always be present, to avoid distortions, given the speciﬁcity of each reservoir and lake under study. 3.4.8 Control of eutrophication The control strategies usually adopted can be classiﬁed into two broad categories (Thomann and Mueller, 1987; von Sperling, 1995a): • Preventive measures (action in the catchment area) • Reduction of external sources • Corrective methods (action in the lake or reservoir) • Mechanical processes • Chemical processes • Biological processes a) Preventive methods Preventive methods, which comprise the reduction of the phosphorus input to the lake by acting on external sources, can include strategies related to the wastewater or to the stormwater drainage. The control strategies for wastewater are illustrated in Figure 3.19. Control of wastewater • Wastewater treatment with nutrient removal (tertiary treatment) • Sewage diversion to downstream of the reservoir, associated with conven- tional (secondary) wastewater treatment • Exportation of the wastewater to another catchment area without lakes or reservoirs, followed by conventional wastewater treatment • Land inﬁltration of the wastewater Control of stormwater drainage • Control of the land use and occupation in the catchment area • Protective green belts along the reservoir and its tributaries • Construction of P retention reservoirs upstream of the main reservoir",

Biological phosphorus removal from the wastewater is currently consolidated and undertaken in many countries. The process is based on alternating between aerobic and anaerobic conditions, a situation which makes a certain group of mi- croorganisms (phosphate accumulating organisms) assimilate a higher quantity of phosphorus than would be required in their usual metabolic processes. When removing these bacteria from the system in the biological excess sludge, the phos- phorus absorbed by them is also removed. With biological P removal, efﬂuents with concentrations of 0.5 mgP/L can be reached, although it is more appropriate to consider a more conservative value of 1.0 mgP/L. Chapters 35 and 36 cover in detail the process of biological P removal. Phosphorus removal by physical–chemical processes is based on the precipi- tation of phosphorus after the addition of aluminium sulphate, ferric chloride or lime. The consumption of chemical products and the sludge generation are high. Physical–chemical polishing after biological P removal can generate efﬂuents with concentrations in the order of 0.1 mgP/L. b) Corrective methods Corrective methods that can be adopted can include one or more of the strategies listed in Table 3.15 (von Sperling, 1995a).

Addition of water with a higher quality • Dilution technique that reduces the nutrient concentration in the water body. • Its application limits the formation of hydrogen sulphide in the hypolimnion, thus avoiding ﬁsh mortality. 5. Sediment removal • Upper layers of the sediment are removed by dredging, favouring the exposure of layers with a lower polluting potential. • The sludge removed, after treatment, can be used as a soil conditioner. 6. Covering of the sediment • Corrective method to avoid the release of nutrients in the deeper layers. • The sediment is isolated from the rest of the water body by covering it with plastic material or ﬁnely particulated substances. • Expensive method which presents difﬁculties in its installation. 7. Removal of the aquatic macrophytes • Aquatic macrophytes, which, when present in excessive numbers may interfere with various water uses, can be removed by manual or mechanical processes. 8. Removal of the planktonic biomass • The planktonic biomass, which presents a large pollutant storage capacity, may be removed by centrifuging or by the use of microsieves. 9. Shading • Acts against the excessive vegetation growth, by reducing the level of solar radiation received, by means of: – tree planting in the shores of small water bodies – installation of panels in the shores – application of supernatant material or light dyes at the surface layer",

In the perspective of this book, these standards are an important topic in the prevention and control of the impacts of the discharges of wastewater, which are the main issue of this chapter. This section, based on von Sperling and Fattal (2001) and von Sperling & Chernicharo (2002), analyses the practical implementation of standards, with a special focus on developing countries. The impact of the discharge of urban wastewater into rivers, lakes, estuaries and the sea is a matter of great concern in most countries. An important point in this scenario is the establishment of an adequate legislation for the protection of the quality of water resources, this being a crucial point in the environmental and public health development of all countries. Most developed nations have already surpassed the basic stages of water pollution problems, and are currently ﬁne- tuning the control of micro-pollutants, the impacts of pollutants in sensitive areas or the pollution caused by drainage of stormwater. However, developing nations are under constant pressure, from one side observing or attempting to follow the inter- national trends of frequently lowering the limit concentrations of the standards, and from the other side being unable to reverse the continuous trend of environmental degradation. The increase in the sanitary infrastructure can barely cope with the net population growth in many countries. The implementation of sanitation and sewage treatment depends largely on political will and, even when this is present, ﬁnancial constraints are the ﬁnal barrier to undermine the necessary steps towards environmental restoration and public health maintenance. Time passes, and the distance between desirable and achievable, between laws and reality, continues to enlarge. Figure 3.20 presents a comparison between the current status of developed and developing countries in terms of actual efﬂuent concentrations of a particular pollutant and its associated discharge standard. In most developed countries, com- pliance occurs for most of the time, and the main concern relates to occasional episodes of non-compliance, at which most of the current effort is concentrated. However, in most developing nations the concentrations of pollutants discharged into the water bodies are still very high, and efforts are directed towards reducing the distance to the discharge standards, and eventually achieving compliance.

The transfer of written codes from paper into really practicable standards, which are used not merely for enforcement, but mainly as an integral part of the public health and environmental protection policy, has been a challenge for most countries.

Standards must be complied with, through enforcement of the legislation, by the entities involved the discharges and use of the water. The following concepts are also important. National standards are deﬁned by each country, have legal status and are based on the speciﬁc conditions of the coun- try itself. Depending on the political structure of the country, regional standards may also be developed, for each state or other form of political division. Usually, regional standards are at least equal to national standards and are often more strin- gent or complete. Guidelines or recommendations are proposed by entities of wide acceptance (e.g. World Health Organization (WHO)), are generic by nature and usually aim at the protection of public health and environment in worldwide terms. Economic, social and cultural aspects, prevailing diseases, acceptable risks and technological development are all particular to each country or region, and are bet- ter taken into account by the country or region itself, when converting guidelines into national/regional standards. This adaptation is crucial, and adequate consid- eration of the guidelines prior to the adoption of standards may be an invaluable tool in the health and environmental development of a country, whereas inadequate consideration may lead to discredit, frustration, unnecessary monetary expendi- ture, unsustainable systems and other problems. The setting of standards should be based on sound, logical, scientiﬁc grounds and should be aimed at achieving a mea- sured or estimated beneﬁt or minimising a given risk for a known cost (Johnstone and Horan, 1994). In practical terms, there are the following types of standards or guidelines of direct interest to the topics of this book: • Discharge (emission, efﬂuent) standards • Quality standards for the receiving water body • Standards or quality guidelines for a certain use of the treated efﬂuent (e.g.: irrigation)",

Table 3.16 describes common problems associated with setting up and implementing standards, especially in developing countries, detailing for each problem how it should be and how it frequently is. One such problem is when guidelines are directly taken as national standards; how it should be is that guidelines are general worldwide values, and each country should adapt the guidelines based on local conditions, and derive the corresponding national standards, but how it frequently is, is that in many cases the adaptation is not done in developing countries, and the worldwide guidelines are directly taken as national standards, without recognising the country's singularities. Another problem is when guideline values are treated as absolute values, and not as target values; how it should be is that guideline values should be treated as target values, to be attained on a short, medium or local term, depending on the country's technological, institutional or financial conditions, however, how it frequently is, is that guideline values are treated as absolute rigid values, leading to simple 'pass' or 'fail' interpretations, without recognising the current difficulty of many countries to comply with them. A third problem is that protection measures that do not lead to immediate compliance with the standards do not obtain licensing or financing; how it should be is that environmental agencies should license and banks should fund control measures (e.g. wastewater treatment plants) which allow for a stepwise improvement of water quality, even though standards are not immediately achieved, but how it frequently is, is that the environmental agencies or financial institutions do not support control measures which, based on their design, do not prove to lead to compliance with the standards, and without licensing or financing, intermediate measures are not implemented, and the ideal solution, even though approved, is also not implemented, because of lack of funds, as a result, no control measures are implemented. Finally, standards are frequently copied from developed countries; how it should be is that national standards should be based on the country's specific economical, institutional, technological and climatic conditions, yet how it frequently is, is that national standards are frequently directly copied from developed countries' standards, either because of lack of confidence on their own capacity, desirability to achieve developed countries' status, lack of knowledge or poor knowledge transfer from international consulting companies, cost implications are not taken into account, and the standards become purely theoretical and are not implemented or enforced.

Table 3.16 continues to detail common problems associated with setting up and implementing standards, especially in developing countries, by contrasting how things should be with how they frequently are. For the problem that standards are not actually enforced, how it should be is that standards should be enforceable and actually enforced, with standard values being achievable and allowing for enforcement based on existing and affordable control measures, and environmental agencies should be institutionally well developed in order to enforce standards, but how it frequently is, is that standards are not enforced, leading to a discredit in their usefulness and application, and creating the culture that standards are to remain on paper only. Concerning the problem that discharge standards are not compatible with water quality standards, how it should be is that in terms of pollution control, the true objective is the preservation of the quality of the water bodies, and while discharge standards exist only by practical (and justifiable) reasons, discharge standards should be compatible with water quality standards, assuming a certain dilution or assimilation capacity of the water bodies, however, how it frequently is, is that even if water quality standards are well set up, based on water quality objectives, discharge standards may not be compatible with them, and some parameters in the discharge standards may be too stringent and others too relaxed, and in this case, different assimilation capacities of the water bodies are implicit, so the aim of protecting the water bodies is thus not guaranteed. Regarding the problem that the number of parameters is frequently inadequate (too many or too few), how it should be is that the list of parameters covered by the national standards should reflect the desired protection of the intended water uses, without excesses or limitations, but how it frequently is, is that in some countries, the standards include an excessively large list of parameters, many of which have no actual regional importance, are very costly to monitor or are not supported by satisfactory laboratory capabilities, while in other situations, standards cover only a limited list of parameters, which are not sufficient to safeguard the intended water uses.

Table 3.16 continues to detail common problems associated with setting up and implementing standards, especially in developing countries, with a problem being that the required percentage of compliance is not defined; how it should be is that it should be clear how to interpret the monitoring results and the related compliance with the standards (e.g. mean values, maximum values, absolute values, percentiles or other criteria), but how it frequently is, is that the non specification of how to treat the monitoring results may lead to different interpretations, which may result in diverging positions as to whether compliance has been achieved or not. Another problem is that low standard values are sometimes below laboratory detection limits; how it should be is that if standards are treated as target values and are well linked with the water quality objectives, they should not be limited by current laboratory detection limits, and in due time, laboratory techniques will improve and be consistent with the standard values, but how it frequently is, is that standards which are below the detection limit are sometimes seen as unjustifiable, which may be true in some cases, but not in many other cases. There is also the problem that there is no institutional development which could support and regulate the implementation of standards; how it should be is that the efficient implementation of standards requires an adequate infrastructure and institutional capacity to license, guide and control polluting activities and enforce standards, but how it frequently is, is that in many countries the health and environmental agencies are not adequately structured or sufficiently equipped, leading to a poor control of the various activities associated with the implementation of standards.",

Finally, excessive expenditure on unjustifiably high standards may lead to population disagreement with really worthwhile standards; how it should be is that standards should really reflect the water quality objectives, and these objectives should result from a consensus from the various segments of the society, directly involved in the catchment area, however, how it frequently is, is that representatives of the society frequently do not participate in the decision-making process, and high costs, which are not seen as bringing correspondingly high benefits, may lead to discredit and disagreement when aiming at implementing standards that are really important for the involved community.

A plant can have, for instance, two tanks built in the ﬁrst stage, and another tank built in the second stage, after it has been veriﬁed that the inﬂuent load has increased, frequently due to the population growth. This stepwise implementation is essential, in order to allow reduction in present value construction costs. However, another concept of stepwise implementation, which should be put in practice, especially in developing countries, is the gradual improvement of the water or wastewater quality. It should be possible, in a large number of situations, to implement in the ﬁrst stage a less efﬁcient process, or a process that removes less pollutants, transferring to a second stage the improvement towards a system more efﬁcient or more wide-reaching in terms of pollutants. If the planning is well structured, the environmental agency could make allowances in the sense of permitting a temporary small violation in the standards in the ﬁrst stage. Naturally a great deal of care must be exercised in not allowing that a temporary situation becomes permanent, which is a very common occurrence in developing coun- tries. This alternative of stepwise development of water or wastewater quality is undoubtedly much more desirable than a large violation of the standards, whose solution is often unpredictable over time. Figure 3.21 presents a typical situation concerning the implementation of wastewater treatment. If a country decides to implement treatment plants that can potentially lead to an immediate compliance with the standards, this will require a large and concentrated effort, since the current water quality is probably very poor, especially in developing countries. This large effort is naturally associated with a large cost. In most instances, the country cannot afford this large cost, and the plant construction is postponed and eventually never put into effect. On the other hand, if the country decides to implement only a partial treatment, ﬁnancial resources may be available.

The environmental agency is a partner in the solution of the problem, and establishes a programme of future improvements. After some time, there are additional funds for expanding the efﬁciency of the treatment plant, and the standards are ﬁnally satisﬁed. In this case, compliance with the standards is likely to be obtained before the alternative without stepwise implementation. Not only wastewater systems should expand on a stepwise basis on developing countries, but also the standards for water quality. There should be a knowledge about the targets that are desired to be achieved over time, and these targets could eventually be the same as the general guidelines. However, with the standards the approach should be different, and the numeric values of the limit concentrations should progress stepwisely towards stringency. The standards should be adapted periodically, eventually reaching the same values as those in the guidelines. The advantages of a stepwise implementation of standards and sanitary infras- tructure are listed in Table 3.17. An important issue in the stepwise approach is how to guarantee that the second and subsequent stages of improvement will be implemented, and not interrupted in the ﬁrst stage. Because of ﬁnancial restrictions, there is always the risk that the subsequent stages will be indeﬁnitely postponed, under the argument that the priority has now shifted to systems that have not yet implemented the ﬁrst stage. Even though this might well be a justiﬁable argument, it cannot be converted into a commonly used excuse. The environmental agency must set up scenarios of intervention targets with the entity responsible for the sanitary system. The scenarios should include the minimum intervention, associated with the ﬁrst stage, and subsequent prospective scenarios, including required measures, beneﬁts, costs and timetable. The formalisation of the commitment also helps in ensuring the continuation of the water quality improvement. 3.5.2.3 The principle of equity The principle of equitymeansthatallpeoples,irrespectiveofrace,culture,religion, geographic position or economic status are entitled to the same life expectancy and quality of life. Broadly speaking, the reasons for a lower quality of life are associ- ated with environmental conditions, and if these improve, life quality is expected to rise accordingly. On this basis, there is no justiﬁcation for accepting different environmental guideline values between developed and developing countries. If guideline values (e.g. WHO guidelines) are treated as absolute values, than only developed countries are more likely to achieve them, and developing nations possibly will not be able to afford the required investments.

The very developed country has been already compliant, and presents a better water quality than actually required. The developed country requires only a small effort and achieves compliance in a short term. The developing country requires a stepwise approach and achieves compliance only on a long term.

One advantage is that polluters are more likely to afford gradual investment for control measures, because polluters and/or water authorities will find it much more feasible to divide investments in different steps, than to make a large and in many cases unaffordable investment. Another advantage is that the present value of construction costs is reduced, as the division of construction costs into different stages leads to a lower present value than a single, large, initial cost, and this aspect is more relevant in countries in which, due to inflation problems, interest rates are high. Furthermore, the cost-benefit of the first stage is likely to be more favourable than in the subsequent stages, since in the first stage, when environmental conditions are poor, usually a large benefit is achieved with a comparatively low cost, meaning that already in the first stage a significant benefit is likely to be achieved, with only a fraction of the overall costs, while in the subsequent stages, the increase of the benefit is not so substantial, but the associated costs are high, so the cost-benefit is then less favourable. Also, there is more time and better conditions to know the wastewater characteristics because the operation of the system will involve monitoring, which, on its course, will allow a good knowledge of the wastewater characteristics, and the design of the second or subsequent stages will be based on the actual characteristics, and not on generic values taken from the literature. An additional advantage is that there is the opportunity to optimise operation, without necessarily making physical expansion, as the experience in the operation of the system will lead to a good knowledge of its behaviour, allowing, in some cases, the optimisation of the process (improvement of efficiency or capacity), without necessarily requiring the physical expansion of the system, and the first stage will be analogous to a pilot plant. Moreover, there is time and opportunity to implement, in the second stage, new techniques or better developed processes, because the availability of new or more efficient processes for wastewater treatment is always increasing with time, process development is continuous and fast, and the second",

This topic is well discussed by Johnstone and Horan (1996) and some of the points are summarised below. Institutional development takes time and the models cannot be directly copied from developed countries. Even though lessons should be learned from other coun- tries that have already passed the basic steps of institutional development, an adap- tation is also required in order to accommodate the countries’ speciﬁc economic, cultural and social conditions. However, experience from other countries can help in structuring the organisations, especially when they are introduced for the ﬁrst time. It must be recognised that institutional development is a continuous process, building on the experience of prior organisations. Another important point is the need to separate the duties and responsibilities of regulating quality with those of achieving standards. This is especially true when private sector operators have to comply with standards. The main points to be emphasised for developing countries are (Johnstone and Horan, 1996): (a) consider the process of institutional development and technical improvementstobelongterm;(b)buildonpastexperiences;(c)separateregulatory and operational duties and responsibilities; (d) develop regulatory systems and procedures needed to enforce standards; (e) ensure that sufﬁcient legal powers are in force; (f) recognise the costs of regulation and legal enforcement.",

In any case, much more important than the discharge standards are the quality standards for the water body, because the quality in the water body is the one really associated with its uses. Discharge standards exist because of a practical aspect: it is easier for the environmental agencies to control, monitor and enforce point discharges, whose responsible agent is known. In a water body receiving multiple discharges, the occasional detection of non-compliance of the standards in the water body is not a trivial matter in terms of assigning those responsible. Therefore, discharge standards play an important role in most countries in the world.",

The requirements to be reached for the efﬂuent are also a function of the speciﬁc legislation that deﬁnes the quality standards for the efﬂuent and for the receiving body. The legislation was also covered in Chapter 3. The removal of pollutants during treatment in order to reach a desired quality or required discharge standard is associated with the concepts of treatment level and treatment efﬁciency.

At the Preliminary level, coarse suspended solids, including larger material and sand, are removed. The Primary treatment level removes settleable suspended solids and particulate (suspended) BOD, which is associated with the organic matter component of the settleable suspended solids. Moving to the Secondary level, both particulate (suspended) BOD, associated with the particulate organic matter present in the raw sewage or the non settleable particulate organic matter not removed in any possibly existing primary treatment, and soluble BOD, associated with the organic matter in the form of dissolved solids, are removed. Finally, the Tertiary treatment level targets the removal of nutrients, pathogenic organisms, non-biodegradable compounds, metals, inorganic dissolved solids, and any remaining suspended solids. A note clarifies that depending on the adopted treatment process, the removal of nutrients by biological processes and pathogens can be considered an integral part of secondary treatment.The removal of pollutants during treatment in order to reach a desired quality or required discharge standard is associated with the concepts of treatment level and treatment efﬁciency. Wastewater treatment is usually classiﬁed according to the following levels (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2): • Preliminary • Primary • Secondary • Tertiary The objective of preliminary treatment is only the removal of coarse solids, while primary treatment aims at removing settleable solids and part of the organic matter. Physical pollutant removal mechanisms are predominant in both levels. In secondary treatment the aim is the removal of organic matter and possibly nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) by predominantly biological mechanisms. The objective of tertiary treatment is the removal of speciﬁc pollutants (usually toxic or non-biodegradable compounds) or the complementary removal of pollutants that were not sufﬁciently removed in the secondary treatment. Tertiary treatment is rare in developing countries. The removal efﬁciency of a pollutant in the treatment or in a treatment stage is given by the formula: E = Co −Ce / Co .100 (4.1) where: E = removal efﬁciency (% ) Co = inﬂuent concentration of the pollutant (mg/L) Ce = efﬂuent concentration of the pollutant (mg/L)",

The concepts of unit operations and unit process are frequently used inter- changeably, because they can occur simultaneously in the same treatment unit. In general, the following deﬁnitions can be adopted (Metcalf & Eddy, 1991): • Physical unit operations: treatment methods in which physical forces are predominant (e.g. screening, mixing, ﬂocculation, sedimentation, ﬂotation, ﬁltration)",

The main mechanisms are listed in Table 4.3. Table 4.4 lists the main processes, operations, and treatment systems frequently used in the treatment of domestic sewage, as a function of the pollutant to be re- moved. These methods are employed in the liquid phase (or liquid lines), which corresponds to the main ﬂow of the liquid (sewage) in sewage treatment works. On the other hand, the solid phase (covered in Section 5) is associated with the solid by-products generated in the treatment, notably sludge. The present text concentrates on the biological treatment of wastewater, which is the reason why physical – chemical treatment systems are not covered (these depend on the ad- dition of chemical products and are used more frequently for the treatment of industrial wastewaters). Table 4.5 presents a summary of the main secondary level domestic sewage treatment systems. The technology of wastewater treatment has various other processes and variants, but the present book addresses only the most fre- quently used systems in warm-climate countries. The ﬂowsheets of the sys- tems described in this table are presented in Figures 4.1a–f. The integration between the various operations and processes listed in Table 4.5 can be seen in the ﬂowsheets. In all ﬂowsheets, besides going to the receiving water body, the efﬂuent may be reused (agricultural / industrial / other) if conditions so permit. In order to allow a better understanding of the main wastewater treatment systems, the remainder of the chapter is devoted to a preliminary descrip- tion of them.

For the pollutant Solids, Coarse solids (>~1 cm) are removed by Screening, involving Retention of the solids with dimensions greater than the spacing between the bars. Suspended solids (>~1 µm) are removed by Sedimentation, which is the Separation of the particles with a density greater than the sewage. Dissolved solids (<~1 µm) are removed by Adsorption, involving Retention on the surface of biomass flocs or biofilms. For the pollutant Organic matter, BOD in suspension (particulate BOD) (>~1 µm) is removed by Sedimentation, involving Separation of the particles with a density greater than the sewage, by Adsorption, involving Retention on the surface of biomass flocs or biofilms, by Hydrolysis, which is the Conversion of the BOD in suspension into soluble BOD by means of enzymes, allowing its stabilisation, and by Stabilisation, which is Utilisation by biomass as food, with conversion into gases, water and other inert compounds. Soluble BOD (<~1 µm) is removed by Adsorption, involving Retention on the surface of biomass flocs or biofilms, and by Stabilisation, involving Utilisation by biomass as food, with conversion into gases, water and other inert compounds. For the pollutant Pathogens, Larger dimensions and/or with protective layer (protozoan cysts and helminth eggs) are removed by Sedimentation, involving Separation of pathogens with larger dimensions and density greater than the sewage, and by Filtration, involving Retention of pathogens in a filter medium with adequate pore size. Lower dimensions (bacteria and viruses) are removed by Adverse environmental conditions, including Temperature, pH, lack of food, competition with other species, predation, by Ultraviolet radiation, which is Radiation from the sun or artificial, and by Disinfection, which is Addition of a disinfecting agent, such as chlorine. For the pollutant Nitrogen, Organic nitrogen is removed by Ammonification, the Conversion of organic nitrogen into ammonia. Ammonia is removed by Nitrification, the Conversion of ammonia into nitrite, and the nitrite into nitrate, by means of nitrifying bacteria, by Bacterial assimilation, the Incorporation of ammonia into the composition of bacterial cells, by Stripping, the Release of free ammonia (NH₃) into the atmosphere, under high pH conditions, and by Break-point chlorination, the Conversion of ammonia into chloramines, through the addition of chlorine. Nitrate is removed by Denitrification, the Conversion of nitrate into molecular nitrogen (N₂), which escapes into the atmosphere, under anoxic conditions. For the pollutant Phosphorus, Phosphate is removed by Bacterial assimilation, the Assimilation in excess of the phosphate from the liquid by phosphate accumulating organisms, which takes place when aerobic and anaerobic conditions are alternated, by Precipitation, which is Phosphorus precipitation under conditions of high pH, or through the addition of metallic salts, and by Filtration, the Retention of phosphorus-rich biomass, after stage of biological excessive P assimilation.",

Summary description of the main biological wastewater treatment systems STABILISATION PONDS Facultative pond: Wastewater ﬂows continuously through a pond especially constructed for wastewater treatment. The wastewater remains in the ponds for many days. The soluble and ﬁne particulate BOD is aerobically stabilised by bacteria which grow dispersed in the liquid medium, while the BOD in suspension tends to settle, being converted anaerobically by bacteria at the bottom of the pond. The oxygen required by the aerobic bacteria is supplied by algae through photosynthesis. The land requirements are high. Anaerobic pond – facultative pond: Around 50 to 65% of the BOD is converted in the anaerobic pond (deeper and with a smaller volume), while the remaining BOD is removed in the facultative pond. The system occupies an area smaller than that of a single facultative pond. Facultative aerated lagoon: The BOD removal mechanisms are similar to those of a facultative pond. However, oxygen is supplied by mechanical aerators instead of through photosynthesis. The aeration is not enough to keep the solids in suspension, and a large part of the sewage solids and biomass settles, being decomposed anaerobically at the bottom. Completely mixed aerated lagoon – sedimentation pond: The energy introduced per unit volume of the pond is high, what makes the solids (principally the biomass) remain dispersed in the liquid medium, in complete mixing. The resulting higher biomass concentration in the liquid medium increases the BOD removal efﬁciency, which allows this pond to have a volume smaller than a facultative aerated lagoon. However, the efﬂuent contains high levels of solids (bacteria) that need to be removed before being discharged into the receiving body. The sedimentation pond downstream provides conditions for this removal. The sludge of the sedimentation pond must be removed every few years. High rate ponds: High rate ponds are conceived in order to maximise algal production, in a totally aerobic environment. To accomplish this, lower depths are employed, allowing light penetration throughout the liquid mass. Therefore, photosynthetic activity is high, leading to high dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH levels. These factors contribute to the increase of the pathogens die-off and to",

Usually a moderate agitation in the liquid is introduced, caused by a low-power mechanical equipment. (Continued ) Maturation ponds: The main objective of maturation ponds is the removal of pathogenic organisms. In maturation ponds prevail environmental conditions which are adverse to these organisms, such as ultraviolet radiation, high pH, high DO, lower temperature (compared with the human intestinal tract), lack of nutrients and predation by other organisms. Maturation ponds are a post-treatment stage for BOD-removal processes, being usually designed as a series of ponds or a single-bafﬂed pond. The coliform removal efﬁciency is very high. LAND DISPOSAL Slow rate system: The objectives may be for (a) wastewater treatment or (b) water reuse through crop production or landscape irrigation. In each case, design criteria are different. Wastewater is applied to the soil, supplying water and nutrients necessary for plant growth. Part of the liquid evaporates, part percolates into the soil, and the largest fraction is absorbed by the plants The surface application rates are very low. The liquid can be applied by sprinkling, graded-border, furrow and drip irrigation. Rapid inﬁltration: Wastewater is applied in shallow basins. The liquid passes through the porous bottom and percolates into the soil. The evaporation loss is lower in view of the higher application rates. Vegetation may or may not be used. The application is intermittent, which provides a rest period for the soil. The most common types are: application for groundwater recharge, recovery using underdrains and recovery using wells. Subsurface inﬁltration: Pre-settled sewage (usually from septic tanks) is applied below the soil surface. The inﬁltration trenches or chambers are ﬁlled with a porous medium, which provides transportation, storage and partial treatment, followed by the inﬁltration itself. Overland ﬂow: Wastewater is distributed in the upper part of vegetated slopes, ﬂows over the slopes and is collected by ditches at the lower part. Treatment occurs in the root-soil system. The application is intermittent. Distribution of wastewater may be by high-pressure sprinklers, low-pressure sprays and gated or perforated pipes or channels. Constructed wetlands: While the former systems are land-based systems, these are aquatic-based systems. The systems are composed by shallow basins or channels in which aquatic plants grow. The system can be of free-water surface (water level above ground level) or subsurface ﬂow (water level below ground level). Biological, chemical and physical mechanisms act on the root–soil system.

The system requires a primary sedimentation tank (frequently septic tanks). The sludge production is low and the excess sludge is already stabilised. Anaerobic reactor – post-treatment: UASB reactors produce an efﬂuent that has difﬁculty in complying with most existing discharge standards. Therefore, some form of post treatment is frequently necessary. The post treatment may be biological (aerobic or anaerobic) or physical-chemical (with the addition of coagulants). Practically all wastewater treatment processes may be used as a post treatment of the anaerobic reactors. The global efﬁciency of the system is usually similar to the one that would be obtained if the process were being applied for raw wastewater. However, land, volume and energy requirements are lower. Sludge production is also lower. ACTIVATED SLUDGE Conventional activated sludge: The biological stage comprises two units: aeration tank (reactor) and secondary sedimentation tank. The biomass concentration in the reactor is very high, due to the recirculation of the settled solids (bacteria) from the bottom of the secondary sedimentation tank. The biomass remains in the system longer than the liquid, which guarantees a high BOD removal efﬁciency. It is necessary to remove a quantity of the sludge (biomass) that is equivalent to what is produced. This excess sludge removed needs to be stabilised in the sludge treatment stage. The oxygen supply is done by mechanical aerators or by diffused air. Upstream of the reactor there is a primary sedimentation tank to remove the settleable solids from the raw sewage. Activated sludge (extended aeration): Similar to the previous system, but with the difference that the biomass stays longer in the system (the aeration tanks are bigger). With this, there is less substrate (BOD) available for the bacteria, which makes them use their own cellular material as organic matter for their maintenance. Consequently, the removed excess sludge (bacteria) is already stabilised. Primary sedimentation tanks are usually not included. Intermittently operated activated sludge (sequencing batch reactors): The operation of the system is intermittent. In this way, the reaction (aerators on) and settling (aerators off) stages occur in different phases in the same tank. When the aerators are turned off, the solids settle, which allows the removal of the clariﬁed efﬂuent (supernatant).",

The anoxic zone can be upstream and/or downstream of the aerated zone. The nitrates formed in the nitriﬁcation process that takes place in the aerobic zone are used in the respiration of facultative microorganisms in the anoxic zones, being reduced to gaseous molecular nitrogen, which escapes to the atmosphere.

Internal recirculations make the biomass to be successively exposed to anaerobic and aerobic conditions. With this alternation, a certain group of microorganisms absorbs phosphorus from the liquid medium, in quantities that are much higher than those which would be normally necessary for their metabolism. The withdrawal of these organisms in the excess sludge results in the removal of phosphorus from the biological reactor. AEROBIC BIOFILM REACTORS Low rate trickling ﬁlter: BOD is stabilised aerobically by bacteria that grow attached to a support medium (commonly stones or plastic material). The sewage is applied on the surface of the tank through rotating distributors. The liquid percolates through the tank and leaves from the bottom, while the organic matter is retained and then further removed by the bacteria. The free spaces permit the circulation of air. In the low rate system there is a low availability of substrate (BOD) for the bacteria, which makes them undergo self-digestion and leave the system stabilised. Sludge that is detached from the support medium is removed in the secondary sedimentation tank. The system requires primary sedimentation. High rate trickling ﬁlter: Similar to the previous system but with the difference that a higher BOD load is applied. The bacteria (excess sludge) need to be stabilised within the sludge treatment. The efﬂuent from the secondary sedimentation tank is recirculated to the ﬁlter in order to dilute the inﬂuent and to guarantee a homogeneous hydraulic load.

The air ﬂow is always upwards, while the liquid ﬂow can be downward or upward. The bioﬁlters with granular material undertake, in the same reactor, the removal of soluble organic compounds and particulate matter. Besides being a support medium for biomass growth, the granular material acts also as a ﬁlter medium.

Weirs (rectangular or triangular) and closed-pipe mea- surement mechanisms can also be adopted. Figure 4.2 presents a typical ﬂowsheet of the preliminary treatment. The removal of coarse solids is frequently done by screens or racks, but static or rotating screens and comminutors can also be used. In the screening, material with dimensions larger than the spaces between the bars is removed (see Figure 4.3). There are coarse, medium, and ﬁne screens, depending on the spacing between the bars. The removal of the retained material can be manual or mechanised. The main objectives of the removal of coarse solids are: • protection of the wastewater transport devices (pumps and piping) • protection of the subsequent treatment units • protection of the receiving bodies The removal of sand contained in the sewage is done through special units called grit chambers (see Figure 4.4). The sand removal mechanism is simply by sedimentation: the sand grains go to the bottom of the tank due to their larger dimensions and density, while the organic matter, which settles much slower, stays in suspension and goes on to the downstream units. There are many processes, from manual to completely mechanised units, for the removal and transportation of the settled grit. The basic purposes of grit removal are: • to avoid abrasion of the equipment and piping • to eliminate or reduce the possibility of obstructions in piping, tanks, ori- ﬁces, siphons, etc • to facilitate the transportation of the liquid, principally the transfer of the sludge in its various phases",

In this way, its removal by simple processes such as sedimentation implies a re- duction in the BOD load directed to the secondary treatment, where its removal is more expensive.

The primary sludge may be digested by conventional digesters, but in some cases it may also be stabilised by lime (simplifying the ﬂowsheet, but further increasing the amount of sludge to be disposed of). Septic tanks are also a form of primary treatment (Figure 4.6). The septic tanks and their variants, such as Imhoff tanks, are basically sedimentation tanks, where the settleable solids are removed to the bottom. These solids (sludge) remain at the bottom of the tanks for a long period of time (various months) which is sufﬁcient for their digestion. This stabilisation occurs under anaerobic conditions. ",

Or- ganic matter is present in the following forms: • dissolved organic matter (soluble or ﬁltered BOD) that is not removed by merely physical operations, such as the sedimentation that occurs in primary treatment; • organic matter in suspension (suspended or particulate BOD), which is largely removed in the occasionally existing primary treatment, but whose solids with slower settleability (ﬁner solids) remain in the liquid mass. The secondary treatment processes are conceived in such a way as to accel- erate the decomposition mechanisms that naturally occur in the receiving bod- ies. Thus, the decomposition of the degradable organic pollutants is achieved under controlled conditions, and at smaller time intervals than in the natural systems. The essence of secondary treatment of domestic sewage is the inclusion of a biological stage. While preliminary and primary treatments have predominantly physical mechanisms, the removal of the organic matter in the secondary stage is carried out through biochemical reactions, undertaken by microorganisms. A great variety of microorganisms take part in the process: bacteria, protozoa, fungi and others. The basis of the whole biological process is the effective contact between these organisms and the organic matter contained in the sewage, in such a way that it can be used as food for the microorganisms. The microorganisms con- vert the organic matter into carbon dioxide, water and cellular material (growth and reproduction of the microorganisms) (see Figure 4.7). This biological decom- position of the organic matter requires the presence of oxygen as a fundamental component of the aerobic processes, besides the maintenance of other favourable environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, contact time, etc. Secondary treatment generally includes preliminary treatment units, but may or may not include primary treatment units. There exists a large variety of secondary treatment processes, and the most common ones are: • Stabilisation ponds • Land disposal systems • Anaerobic reactors • Activated sludge systems • Aerobic bioﬁlm reactors",

In Section 4.7.2, there is a general comparison between all the processes described, including basic data (efﬁciencies, land requirements, power requirements, costs, sludge production, etc.), together with qualitative comparisons and a list of advantages and disadvantages. 4.5.2 Stabilisation ponds The following variants of stabilisation ponds are described brieﬂy in this section: • Facultative ponds • Anaerobic pond – facultative ponds systems • Facultative aerated lagoons • Complete-mix aerated lagoon – sedimentation pond systems • High rate ponds • Maturation ponds a) Facultative ponds Stabilisation ponds are units specially designed and built with the purpose of treating sewage. However, the construction is simple and is principally based on earth movement for digging, ﬁlling and embankment preparation. When facultative ponds receive raw sewage, they are also called primary ponds (a secondary pond would be the one which would receive its inﬂuent from a previous treatment unit, such as anaerobic ponds – see item b in this section). Amongst the stabilisation ponds systems, the process of facultative ponds is the simplest, relying only on natural phenomenon. The inﬂuent enters continuously in one end of the pond and leaves in the opposite end. During this time, which is of the order of many days, a series of events contribute to the puriﬁcation of the sewage. Part of the organic matter in suspension (particulate BOD) tends to settle, con- stituting the bottom sludge. This sludge undergoes a decomposition process by anaerobic microorganisms and is converted into carbon dioxide, methane and other compounds. The inert fraction (non-biodegradable) stays in this bottom layer. The dissolved organic matter (soluble BOD), together with the small-dimension organic matter in suspension (ﬁne particulate BOD), does not settle and stays dispersed in the liquid mass. Its decomposition is through facultative bacteria that have the capacity to survive, either in the presence or in the absence of free oxygen (but presence of nitrate), hence the designation of facultative, which also deﬁnes the name of the pond. These bacteria use the organic matter as energy source, which is released through respiration. The presence of oxygen is necessary in aerobic respiration, and it is supplied to the medium by the photosynthesis carried out by the algae. There is an equilibrium between consumption and the production of oxygen and carbon dioxide (see Figure 4.8).",

A light energy source, in this case represented by the sun, is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. For this reason, locations with high solar radiation and low cloudiness are favourable for the implementation of facultative ponds. Photosynthesis is higher near the water surface, as it depends on solar energy. Typical pond depths are between 1.5 and 2.0 m. When deep regions in the pond are reached, the light penetration is low, what causes the predominance of oxygen consumption (respiration) over its production (photosynthesis), with the possible absence of dissolved oxygen at a certain depth.

Besides, photosynthesis only occurs during the day, and during the night the absence of oxygen can prevail. Owing to these facts, it is essential that the main bacteria responsible for the stabilisation of the organic matter are facultative, so that they can survive and proliferate, either in the presence or in the absence of oxygen (but only under anoxic, and not strict anaerobic conditions). The process of facultative ponds is essentially natural, as it does not require any equipment. For this reason, the stabilisation of the organic matter takes place at lower rates, implying the need of a long detention time in the pond (usually greater than 20 days). To be effective, photosynthesis needs a large exposure surface area to make the most of the solar energy by the algae, also implying the need of large units. As a result, the total area required by facultative ponds is the largest within all the wastewater treatment processes (excluding the land disposal processes). On the other hand, because the process is totally natural, it is associated to a high operational simplicity, which is a factor of fundamental importance in developing countries. b) Anaerobic pond – facultative ponds systems The process of facultative ponds, in spite of having a satisfactory efﬁciency, re- quires a large area that is often not available in the locality in question. There is therefore, the need to ﬁnd solutions that could imply the reduction of the total area required. One of these solutions is the system of anaerobic ponds followed by facul- tative ponds. In this case, the facultative pond is also called a secondary pond, since it receives the inﬂuent from an upstream treatment unit, and not the raw sewage. The raw sewage enters a pond that has smaller dimensions and is deeper (around 4 to 5 m). Owing to the smaller dimensions of this pond, photosynthesis practi- cally does not occur. In the balance between oxygen consumption and production, consumption is much higher. Therefore, anaerobic conditions predominate in this ﬁrst pond, which is consequently called an anaerobic pond. Anaerobic bacteria have a slower metabolic and reproduction rate than the aerobic bacteria. For a detention time of only 2 to 5 days in the anaerobic pond, there is only partial decomposition of the organic matter.

The overall area requirement (anaerobic + facultative pond) is such, that land savings in the order of 1/3 are obtained, compared with just a single facultative pond. The working principles of this facultative pond. are exactly as described in item a. Figure 4.10 shows a typical ﬂowsheet of a system of anaerobic ponds followed by facultative ponds. The efﬁciency of the system is similar or only slightly higher than that of a single facultative pond. The system is also conceptually simple and easy to operate. However, the existence of an anaerobic stage in an open unit is always a cause for concern, due to the possibility of the release of malodours. If the system is well balanced, then the generation of bad smells should not occur. However, occasional operational problems could lead to the release of hydrogen sulphide, responsible for a bad smell. For this reason, this system should, whenever possible, be located far from residences. c) Facultative aerated lagoon If a predominantly aerobic system is desired, with even smaller dimensions, a facultative aerated lagoon can be used. The main difference in relation to a con- ventional facultative pond is regarding the form of the oxygen supply. While in facultative ponds the oxygen is mainly obtained from photosynthesis, in the case of facultative aerated lagoons the oxygen is supplied by mechanical equipment called aerators. The most commonly used mechanical aerators in aerated ponds are those with a vertical axis that rotates at a high speed, causing great turbulence in the water. This turbulence favours the penetration of atmospheric oxygen into the liquid mass, where it is then dissolved. A greater oxygen introduction is achieved, in comparison with the conventional facultative pond, which leads to a faster decomposition of the organic matter. Because of this, the detention time of the wastewater in the pond can be less (in the order of 5 to 10 days for domestic sewage). Consequently, the land requirements are much smaller. The pond is called facultative by the fact that the level of energy introduced by the aerators is only sufﬁcient for the oxygenation, but not to maintain the solids (biomass and wastewater solids) in suspension in the liquid mass. In this way, the",

Only the soluble and ﬁne particulate BOD remains in the liquid mass, undergoing aerobic decomposition. Therefore, the pond behaves like a conventional facultative pond (see Figure 4.11). Aerated lagoons are less simple in terms of operation and maintenance, when compared with the conventional facultative ponds, owing to the introduction of mechanisation. Therefore, the reduction of the reduction of the land requirements is achieved with a certain rising in the operational level, along with the introduction of electricity consumption. d) Complete-mix aerated lagoon – sedimentation pond systems A way of reducing the aerated pond volume even further is to increase the aera- tion level per unit volume of the lagoon, thus creating a turbulence that, besides guaranteeing oxygenation, allows all the solids to be maintained in suspension in the liquid medium. The denomination of complete mix is because of the high degree of energy per unit volume, which is responsible for the total mixing of all the constituents in the pond. Amongst the solids maintained in suspension and in complete mixing are the biomass, besides the organic matter of the raw sewage. There is, therefore, a larger concentration of bacteria in the liquid medium as well as a larger organic matter – biomass contact. Consequently, the efﬁciency of the system increases and allows the volume of the aerated pond to be greatly reduced. The typical detention time in an aerated pond is in the order of 2 to 4 days. However, in spite of the high efﬁciency of this lagoon in the removal of the organic matter originally present in the sewage, a new problem is created. The biomass stays in suspension in all the volume and thus leaves with the pond efﬂuent. This biomass is, in a way, also organic matter (particulate BOD), even if of a different nature of the BOD of the raw sewage. If this new organic matter were discharged into the receiving body, it would also exert an oxygen demand and cause a deterioration in the water quality. Therefore, it is important that there is a unit downstream in which the suspended solids (predominantly the biomass) can settle and be separated from the liquid",

Therefore, it is important that there is a unit downstream in which the suspended solids (predominantly the biomass) can settle and be separated from the liquid (ﬁnal efﬂuent). This unit is a sedimentation pond, with the main purpose of per- mitting the settling and accumulation of the solids. The sedimentation pond is designed with short detention times, around 2 days. In this period, the solids will go to the bottom where they will undergo digestion and be stored for a period of some years, after which they will be removed. There are also sedimentation ponds with continuous removal of the bottom sludge, using, for instance, pumps mounted on rafts. The land required for this pond system is the smallest within the pond systems. The energy requirements are similar to or only slightly higher than those in the facultative aerated lagoons. However, the aspects related to sludge handling can be more complicated, due to the fact that there is a smaller storage period in the pond compared with the other systems. If the sludge is removed periodically, this will take place with an approximate frequency of around 2 to 5 years. The removal of the sludge is a laborious and expensive task. Figure 4.12 illustrates the ﬂowsheet of the system. e) High rate ponds High rate algal ponds are conceived to maximise the production of algae in a to- tally aerobic environment. To accomplish this, the ponds are shallow (less than 1.0 m depth), thus guaranteeing the penetration of light in all the liquid mass. Consequently, the photosynthetic activity is high, leading to high dissolved oxy- gen concentrations and an increase in pH (consumption of carbonic acid in the photosynthesis). These factors contribute to the increase in the death rate of the pathogenic microorganisms and the removal of nutrients, which is the main objec- tive of the high rate ponds. Ammonia removal occurs by stripping of the free ammonia (NH3), since in high pH conditions the ammonia equilibrium shifts in the direction of free ammonia (with a reduction in the concentration of the ammonium ion NH+ 4 ). The increase in the NH3 concentration leads to its release to the atmosphere. Phosphorus removal also occurs as a result of the high pH, which causes the precipitation of the phosphates into the form of hydroxyapatite or struvite. The high rate ponds receive a high organic load per unit surface area. There is usually the introduction of moderate agitation",

Its function is not to aerate, but to gently move the liquid mass. This agitation improves the contact of the inﬂuent with the bacteria and algae, reduces dead zones and facilitates the exposure of a larger quantity of algae to sun light. The conﬁguration of the pond can be in the form of a carrousel, similar to an oxidation ditch (Figure 4.13). The high rate ponds can come after facultative ponds, in which a large part of the BOD is removed, leaving the polishing in terms of pathogen and nutrient removal for the high rate ponds. f) Maturation ponds Maturation ponds aim at polishing the efﬂuent from any stabilisation pond system previously described or, in broader terms, from any sewage treatment system. The main objective of maturation ponds is the removal of pathogenic organisms and not an additional BOD removal. Maturation ponds are an economic alternative for the disinfection of the efﬂuent, in comparison to more conventional methods, such as chlorination. The ideal environment for pathogenic microorganisms is the human intestinal tract. Outside it, whether in the sewerage system, in the sewage treatment or in the receiving body, the pathogenic organisms tend to die. Various factors contribute to this, such as temperature, solar radiation, pH, food shortage, predator organisms, competition, toxic compounds, etc. The maturation pond is designed in such a way as to optimise some of these mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms become more effective with lower pond depths, which justiﬁes the fact that maturation ponds are shallower than the other types of ponds. Within the mechanisms associated with the pond depth, the following can be mentioned (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994; van Buuren et al, 1995): • Solar radiation (ultraviolet radiation) • High pH (pH > 8.5) • High DO concentration (favouring an aerobic community, which is more efﬁcient in the elimination of coliforms) Maturation ponds should reach extremely high coliform removal efﬁciencies (E > 99.9 or 99.99% ), so that the efﬂuent can comply with usual standards or guidelines for direct use (e.g. for irrigation) or for the maintenance of the various uses of the receiving body (e.g. bathing). The ponds also usually reach total removal of helminth eggs.",

In order to maximise the coliform removal efﬁciency, the maturation ponds are designed with one of the following two conﬁgurations: (a) three or four ponds in series (see Figure 4.14) or (b) a single pond with bafﬂes. 4.5.3 Land disposal The most common destinations for the ﬁnal disposal of treated liquid efﬂuents are water courses and the sea. However, land disposal is also a viable process, applied in various locations around the world. The land application of wastewater can be considered as a form of ﬁnal disposal, of treatment (primary, secondary or tertiary level) or both. Land application of wastewater leads to groundwater recharge and/or to evapotranspiration. Sewage supplies the plants with water and nutrients. In the soil, a pollutant has basically four possible destinations: • retention in the soil matrix • retention by the plants • appearance in the underground water • collection by underdrains Various mechanisms in the soil act in the removal of the pollutants: • physical (settling, ﬁltration, radiation, volatilisation, dehydration) • chemical (oxidation and chemical reactions, precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange, complexation, photochemical breakdown) • biological (biodegradation and predation) The capacity of the soil to assimilate complex organic compounds depends on its properties and on climatic conditions. Inﬁltration rates and types of vegetation are important factors in the use of soil as a medium for the degradation of organic compounds.Thesereactionsrequiregoodsoilaeration,whichisinverselyrelatedto the humidity of the soil. Insufﬁcient aeration leads to a lower assimilation capacity of the organic compounds by the soil. Almost all soil types are efﬁcient in the removal of organic matter. The removal results from the ﬁltering action of the soil, followed by the biological oxidation of the organic material. Soils with clay (ﬁne texture) or soils with a considerable quantity of organic matter will also retain",

The most common types of land application are: Soil-based systems: • slow-rate systems • rapid inﬁltration • subsurface inﬁltration • overland ﬂow Aquatic-based systems: • constructed wetlands Aquatic-based systems (constructed wetlands) are included in this section for didactic reasons, although they could have been presented in the section of stabil- isation ponds, which are also aquatic-based systems. The selection of the treatment method is a function of various factors, including required efﬁciency, climatic conditions, depth to ground water, soil permeability, slope etc. The application of wastewater can be done by methods such as sprinklers, furrows, graded border, drip irrigation and others. a) Slow-rate systems Depending on the design objective, slow-rate systems can be classiﬁed according to two types (WPCF, 1990): • Slow inﬁltration systems. Main objective: wastewater treatment. The amount of wastewater applied is not controlled by crop requirements. For municipal wastewaters, loading rates are controlled either by nitrogen load- ing or soil permeability. The systems are designed to maximise the amount of wastewater applied per unit land area. • Crop irrigation systems. Main objective: water reuse for crop production (wastewater treatment is an additional objective). The systems are designed to apply sufﬁcient wastewater to meet crop irrigation requirements. Load- ing rates are based on the crop irrigation requirement and the application efﬁciency of the distribution system. Nitrogen loading must be checked to avoid excess nitrogen. In crop irrigation systems, the objective is to supply the wastewater to the soil in quantities compatible with the nutrient requirements of the crops. However, initially the microbiological and biochemical characteristics of the sewage should be evaluated, taking into consideration the type of crop, soil, irrigation system and the form in which the product will be used or consumed. Only after the veriﬁcation that the sewage meets the conditions speciﬁed by the health standards should the evaluation of the chemical components be considered (Mattos, 1998). Figure 4.15 presents a ﬂowsheet of a slow-rate system. The irrigation with wastewater can be done by ﬂooding, furrows, sprinkler and dripping.",

Loamy soils (medium texture) are indicated because they exhibit the best bal- ance for wastewater renovation and drainage. The depth to the water table should be greater than 1.5 m to prevent groundwater contamination. The application rates must be compatible with the evapotranspiration of the crop in the period, therefore depending on the type of crop and the climatic con- ditions. In arid zones, wastewater can be used for irrigation throughout the year. On the other hand, in wet areas, the application of wastewater in rainy periods can lead to anaerobic conditions and consequently odour and insect appearance problems. Irrigation constitutes a treatment/disposal system that requires the largest surface area per unit of wastewater treated. On the other hand, it is the natural system with the highest efﬁciency. The plants are those mainly responsible for the removal of nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, while the microorganisms in the soil perform the removal of the organic substances. There is also a high removal of pathogenic organisms during the percolation through the soil (Mattos, 1998). b) Rapid inﬁltration The objective of the rapid inﬁltration system is to use the soil as a ﬁltering medium for the wastewater. This system is characterised by the percolation of the wastewa- ter, which is puriﬁed by the ﬁltering action of the porous medium. The percolated wastewater may be used for groundwater recharge or be collected by underdrains or wells. The rapid inﬁltration method requires the lowest area within all the land disposal processes. Wastewater is applied in shallow inﬁltration basins, from which wastewater percolates through the soil. The application is intermittent, in order to allow a resting period for the soil, during which the soil dries and re-establishes aerobic conditions. Due to the higher application rates, evaporation losses are small and most of the liquid percolates through the soil, undergoing treatment. The application can be done by direct discharge (furrows, channels, perforated pipes) or by high capacity sprinklers. Vegetation growth may or may not occur,",

Figure 4.16 presents a ﬂowsheet of a rapid inﬁltration system. c) Subsurface inﬁltration In subsurface inﬁltration systems, pre-settled or pre-treated sewage is applied below ground level. The inﬁltration sites are prepared in buried excavations, and ﬁlled in with a porous medium. The ﬁlling medium maintains the structure of the excavation, allows free sewage ﬂow and provides sewage storage during peak ﬂows. The sewage percolates through unsaturated soil, where additional treatment occurs. This treatment process is similar to rapid inﬁltration, the main difference residing in the application below ground level. The subsurface inﬁltration systems have the following variants: • inﬁltration trenches or pits (without ﬁnal efﬂuent: wastewater percolates to groundwater) • ﬁltration trenches (with ﬁnal efﬂuent: collection by underdrain system) The subsurface inﬁltration systems are normally used following septic tanks (Figure 4.17) and, in some cases, after further treatment provided by systems such as anaerobic ﬁlters. The applicability is usually for small residential areas or rural dwellings. d) Overland ﬂow Overland ﬂow systems consist of the application of untreated (at least screened) or pre-treated wastewater in the upper part of sloped terraces, planted with water resistantgrasses.Waste water ﬂows gently downwards,having contact with the root- soil system, in which biochemical reactions take place.

The slope should be mod- erate (between 2 and 8% ). The use of vegetation is essential to increase the absorption rate of the nutri- ents and the loss of water by transpiration. Besides this, the vegetation represents a barrier to the free surface ﬂow of the liquid in the soil, increasing the reten- tion of suspended solids and avoiding erosion. This gives better conditions for the development of the microorganisms that will carry out the various biochem- ical reactions. The vegetation should be perennial, water tolerant grasses. Local agricultural extension agents should be consulted. Wastewater application can be done by sprinklers, gated pipes, slotted or per- forated pipes or bubbling oriﬁces (WPCF, 1990).

The natural wetlands include marshes, swamps and similar areas, that shelter di- verse forms of aquatic life. Constructed wetlands are purposely built wastewater treatment processes, which consist of ponds, basins or shallow canals (usually with a depth of less than 1.0 m) that shelter aquatic plants, and use biological, chemical and physical mechanisms to treat the sewage. The constructed wetlands usually have an im- permeable layer of clay or synthetic membrane, and structures to control the ﬂow direction, hydraulic detention time and water level. Depending on the system, they can contain an inert porous medium such as stones, gravel or sand. Constructed wetlands are different from natural wetlands because of human interference, such as landﬁlls, drainage, ﬂow alterations and physical properties. The direct use of natural wetlands for sewage treatment has great environmental impacts and must not be encouraged. There are basically two types of constructed wetlands: • Surface ﬂow (free water surface) wetlands. These resemble natural wet- lands in appearance, because they have plants which can be ﬂoating and/or rooted (emergent or submerged) in a soil layer at the bottom, and wa- ter ﬂows freely between the leaves and the stems of these plants. There can be open areas dominated by these plants or islands exerting habitat functions. Plant genera in use include: (a) emergent: Typha, Phragmites, Scirpus, (b) submerged: Potamogeon, Elodea, etc., (c) ﬂoating: Eichornia (water hyacinth), Lemna (duckweed). Native plants are preferred. These wetlands present a very complex aquatic ecology. They may or may not have a lined bottom, depending on the environmental requirements. Water depth is between 0.6 and 0.9 m for the vegetated zones (or less, in the case of certain emergent plants), and 1.2 to 1.5 m for free water zones. This type of wetlands is adequate to receive efﬂuent from stabilisation ponds. In these conditions, they occupy an area between 1.5 to 3.0 m2/inhab. • Subsurface ﬂow wetlands (vegetated submersed bed systems). These do not resemble natural wetlands because there is no free water on the surface. There is a bed composed of small stones, gravel, sand or soil that gives support to the growth of aquatic plants. The water level stays below the surface of the bed, and sewage ﬂows in contact with the roots and the rhizomes of the plants (where a bacterial bioﬁlm is developed), not being visible or available for the aquatic biota. Plant genera that have been used are: Typha, Scirpus, Carex and Phragmites. The medium height is between",

A large part of the subsurface zone is anaerobic, with aerobic sites immediately adjacent to the rhizomes and roots. There is a lower potential for the generation of bad odours and the appearance of mosquitoes and rats. These wetlands are suited to receive efﬂuents from septic tanks and anaerobic reactors, but not from stabilisation ponds, because of the presence of algae.

Regarding the direction of the water ﬂow, the wetlands can be classiﬁed as: • Vertical ﬂow. Typically, a ﬁlter of sand or gravel planted with vegetation. At the bottom of the ﬁlter medium there is a series of underdrains that collect the treated sewage. The operation resembles the routine of a ﬁlter, with dosing and draining cycles, therefore, differing from the conventional conception of wetlands. With intermittent dosing, the ﬂow is normally through unsaturated media. • Horizontal ﬂow. The most classical conception of constructed wetlands. May be with surface or subsurface ﬂow. Figure 4.19 illustrates the main variants of constructed wetlands. Constructed wetlands do not perform well in the treatment of raw sewage. Some form of primary or secondary treatment (e.g. stabilisation ponds or anaerobic reactors) must precede this process (Figure 4.20). In the case of having previous secondary treatment, low values of BOD, SS and nitrogen can be reached. The layout of wetlands is usually in cells in series or in parallel.

Of these solids, the largest part tends to accumulate at the inlet end of the unit. The operation and maintenance of constructed wetlands is very simple. Besides the activities related with the preceding treatment, the maintenance of the wetlands is usually associated with the control of undesired aquatic plants and mosquitoes (which are not normally a problem in well designed and operated subsurface ﬂow systems). The removal of the plants is not normally necessary, but a certain pruning or replanting can be necessary to maintain the desired ﬂow conditions and treatment. 4.5.4 Anaerobic reactors There are many variants of anaerobic reactors. This section presents only the two most widely applied for domestic sewage treatment: • anaerobic ﬁlter (frequently treating septic tank efﬂuents) • UASB (upﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket) reactor a) Septic tank – anaerobic ﬁlter system The system of septic tanks followed by anaerobic ﬁlters (Figure 4.21) has been widely used in rural areas and in small sized communities. The septic tanks remove most of the suspended solids, which settle and undergo anaerobic digestion at the bottom of the tank. The septic tank can be a single-chamber tank or a two-compartment tank (called an Imhoff tank). In the single chamber tank, there is no physical separation between",

In the single chamber tank, there is no physical separation between the regions of the raw sewage solids sedimentation and bottom sludge digestion. The single chamber tanks can be single or in series. In the Imhoff tank, settling occurs in the upper compartment (settling compart- ment). The settled solids pass through an opening at the bottom of the compartment and are directed to the bottom compartment (digestion compartment). The accu- mulated sludge then undergoes anaerobic digestion. The gases originating from the anaerobic digestion do not interfere with the settling process, as they cannot penetrate inside the sedimentation chamber. Because septic tanks are sedimentation tanks (no biochemical reactions in the liquid phase), BOD removal is limited. The efﬂuent, still with high organic matter concentration, goes to the anaerobic ﬁlter, where further removal takes place under anaerobic conditions. The ﬁlter is a bioﬁlm reactor: the biomass grows attached to a support medium, usually stone. The following points are characteristic of anaerobic ﬁlters, differing from the trickling ﬁlters, which are also bioﬁlm reactors (see Section 4.5.6): • the liquid ﬂow is upwards, i.e. the inlet is at the bottom and the outlet at the top of the anaerobic ﬁlter • the anaerobic ﬁlter works submerged, i.e. the free spaces are ﬁlled with liquid • the unit is closed • the BOD load applied per unit volume is very high, which guarantees anaerobic conditions Figure 4.21. Typical ﬂowsheet of a system of a septic tank followed by an anaerobic ﬁlter (liquid phase) The efﬁciency of a septic tank – anaerobic ﬁlter is usually less compared with fully aerobic systems, although in most situations sufﬁcient. The system has been widely used for small populations, but there has been a trend in terms of anaerobic treatment favouring the use of anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (described below). Sludge production in anaerobic systems is very low. The excess sludge is already digested and can go directly to dewatering(in this system, typically by drying beds).",

The excess sludge is already digested and can go directly to dewatering(in this system, typically by drying beds). Being an anaerobic system, there is always a risk of generation of bad odours. However, proper design and operational procedures can contribute to the reduction of these risks. It should also be remembered that the septic tank and the anaerobic reactors are closed units. b) Upﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors The upﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors are currently the main trend in wastewater treatment in some warm-climate countries, either as single units, or followed by some form of post treatment. In the UASB reactors, the biomass grows dispersed in the liquid, and not attached to a support medium, as in the case of anaerobic ﬁlters. When biomass grows it can form small granules, which are a result of the agglutination of various microorganisms. These small granules tend to serve as a support medium for other organisms. The granulation increases the efﬁciency of the system, but it is not essential for the working of the reactor, and is actually difﬁcult to be obtained with domestic wastewater. The concentration of the biomass in the reactor is very high, justifying the name of sludge blanket. Owing to this high concentration, the volume required for the UASB reactor is greatly reduced in comparison with all other treatment systems. The liquid enters at the bottom, where it meets the sludge blanket, leading to the adsorption of the organic matter by the biomass. The ﬂow is upward. As a result of the anaerobic activity, gases are formed (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and the bubbles also present a rising tendency. The upper part of the anaerobic sludge blanket reactor presents a structure, whose functions are the separation and accumulation of the gas and the separation and return of the solids (biomass). In this way, the biomass is kept in the system (leading to high concentrations in the reactor), and only a minor fraction leaves with the efﬂuent. This structure is called a three-phase separator, as it separates the liquid, solids, and gases. The form of the separator is frequently that of an inverted cone or pyramid. The gas is collected in the upper part of the separator, in the gas compartment, from where it can be removed for reuse (energy from methane) or burning. The solids settle in the upper part of the separator, in the settling compartment, and drain down the steeply inclined walls until they return to the reactor body. In this way, a large part of the biomass",

Owing to the high solids retention, the hydraulic detention time can be low (in the order of 6 to 10 h). Because the gas bubbles do not penetrate the settling zone, the separation of the solids-liquid is not impaired. The efﬂuent is relatively clariﬁed when it leaves the settling compartment, and the concentration of the biomass in the reactor is maintained at a high level.

The sludge wasted from the reactor is already digested and thickened, and may be simply dewatered in drying beds or other dewatering process. The dewaterability of the sludge is very good. The plant ﬂowsheet is simpliﬁed even more by the fact that, differently from anaerobic ﬁlters and other systems, there is no need for primary settling. Figure 4.23 presents the ﬂowsheet of a wastewater treatment system comprised by a UASB reactor. The risk of generation or release of malodours can be greatly reduced by a careful design, not only in the kinetics calculations, but mainly in the hydraulic aspects. The complete sealing-off of the reactor, including a submerged exit of the efﬂuent and the reduction of weirs, contributes noticeably to the reduction of these risks. The adequate operation of the reactor also contributes to this. A characteristic aspect of this process is the limitation in the BOD removal efﬁciency, which is around 70% , therefore lower than in most of the other sys- tems. This must not be considered a disadvantage in itself, but as a characteristic of the process. To reach the desired efﬁciency, some form of post-treatment must follow the UASB reactors. The post-treatment process can be any of the secondary processes (aerobic or anaerobic) covered in this chapter, or a physical–chemical process, such as dissolved air ﬂotation. The difference is that the post treatment stage is much more compact, since around 70% of the organic load has been pre- viously removed in the anaerobic stage. Besides this, in the case of post-treatment processes that incorporate aeration, the consumption of energy is less, by virtue of the lower inﬂuent organic load to the aerated tank.

Therefore, an economy in the construction and operation costs is usually obtained, in comparison with conventional systems not preceded by an anaerobic stage. Figure4.24illustratessomeofthemainpossiblecombinationsofUASBreactors with post-treatment systems. It can be observed that in the UASB – activated sludge and UASB – bioﬁlm aerobic reactor systems, the aerobic biological excess sludge is simply returned to the UASB reactor, where it undergoes digestion and thickening with the anaerobic sludge, dispensing with the separate digestion and thickening units for the aerobic sludge. Thus a large simpliﬁcation in the overall ﬂowsheet is obtained, including the liquid (sewage) and solid (sludge) phases. 4.5.5 Activated sludge system There are many variants of the activated sludge process, and the present section covers only the main ones. Under this perspective, activated sludge systems may be classiﬁed according to the following categories: • Division according to the sludge age (see concept of sludge age in item a below): • Conventional activated sludge • Extended aeration • Division according to ﬂow: • Continuous ﬂow • Intermittent ﬂow (sequencing batch reactors and variants) • Division regarding the treatment objectives: • Removal of carbon (BOD) • Removal of carbon and nutrients (N and/or phosphorus)",

In this case, primary sedimentation tanks (if existing) are substituted by the anaerobic reactor, and the excess sludge from the aerobic stage, if not yet stabilised, is pumped back to the anaerobic reactor, where it undergoes thickening and digestion. Biological nutrient removal is less efﬁcient with the anaerobic pre-treatment, and adaptations or incorporation of physical-chemical treatment may be necessary. a) Conventional activated sludge When analysing the aerated pond systems described in the previous items, it be- comes evident that a reduction of the volume required could be reached by in- creasing the biomass concentration in suspension in the liquid. The more bacteria there are in suspension, the greater the food consumption is going to be, thus the greater the assimilation of the organic matter present in the raw sewage. Within this concept, analysing the previously described aerated ponds – settling ponds system, it can be observed that there is a storage of bacteria still active in the settling unit. If part of these bacteria is returned to the aeration unit, the concentration of the bacteria in this unit will be greatly increased. This is the basic principle of the activated sludge system, in that the solids are recycled by pumping, from the bottom of the settling unit, to the aeration unit. The following items are therefore essential in the activated sludge system (liquid ﬂow) (see Figure 4.25): • aeration tank (reactor) • settling tank (secondary sedimentation tank, also called ﬁnal clariﬁers) • pumps for the sludge recirculation • removal of the biological excess sludge The biomass can be separated in the secondary sedimentation tank because of its property of ﬂocculating. This is due to the fact that many bacteria have a gelatinous matrix that permits their agglutination. The ﬂoc has larger dimensions, which facilitates settling (see Figure 4.26). The concentration of the suspended solids in the aeration tank of the activated sludge system is more than 10 times greater than in a",

The retention time of the solids in the system is called sludge age or solids retention time, which is of the order of 4 to 10 days in the conventional activated sludge system. It is this longer retention of the solids in the system that guarantees the high efﬁciency of the activated sludge, as the biomass has sufﬁcient time to metabolise practically all of the organic matter in the sewage. In the UASB reactor described in the previous section, the biomass is returned to the digestion compartment by gravity from the settling compartment situated on top of the digestion compartment and, therefore, the solids retention time is also greater than the hydraulic detention time.

To save in terms of energy for the aeration, part of the organic matter (in suspension, settleable) of the sewage is removed before the aeration tank, in the primary sedimentation tank. Therefore, the conven- tional activated sludge systems have as an integral part also the primary treatment (Figure 4.27). Figure 4.27. Typical ﬂowsheet of the conventional activated sludge system (liquid phase) Owing to the continuous arrival of food in the form of BOD to the aeration tank, bacteria grow and reproduce continuously. If an indeﬁnite population growth were allowed, the bacteria would reach excessive concentrations in the aeration tank, making the transfer of oxygen to all bacterial cells difﬁcult. Besides this, the secondary sedimentation tank would become overloaded, the solids would not settle well and they would start to leave with the ﬁnal efﬂuent, thus deteriorating its quality. To maintain the system in equilibrium, it is necessary to draw approx- imately the same quantity of biomass that has increased by reproduction. This is, therefore, the biological excess sludge that can be wasted directly from the reactor or the recirculation line. The excess sludge must undergo additional treatment in the sludge treatment line. The conventional activated sludge system has low land requirements and has very good removal efﬁciencies. However, the ﬂowsheet of the system is more complex than in most other treatment systems, requiring more skill for its control and operation. Energy costs for aeration are higher than for aerated ponds. b) Extended aeration Intheconventionalactivatedsludgesystem,theaverageretentiontimeofthesludge in the system is between 4 to 10 days. With this sludge age, the biomass removed in the excess sludge still requires a stabilisation stage in the sludge treatment. This is due to the high level of biodegradable organic matter in their cell composition. However, if the biomass is retained in the system for a longer period, with a sludge age around 18 to 30 days (thus the name extended aeration), receiving the same BOD load as the conventional system, there is a lower food availabil- ity for the bacteria. Owing to the higher sludge age, the reactor has a greater volume (the liquid detention time is around 16 to 24 hours). Therefore, there is",

Owing to the higher sludge age, the reactor has a greater volume (the liquid detention time is around 16 to 24 hours). Therefore, there is less organic matter per unit volume of the aeration tank, and per unit microbial mass. Consequently, in order to survive, the bacteria start to use in their metabolic processes the organic matter from their cellular material. This cellular organic matter is converted into carbon dioxide and water through respiration. This cor- responds to a stabilisation (digestion) of the biomass, taking place in the aera- tion tank. While in the conventional system the sludge stabilisation is carried out separately (in sludge digesters in the sludge treatment line), in extended aera- tion systems the digestion is done concurrently with the BOD stabilisation in the reactor. As there is no need to stabilise separately the excess biological sludge, the generation of another type of sludge in the system that would require subsequent treatment is also avoided. Consequently, extended aeration systems do not usu- ally have primary sedimentation tanks. A great simpliﬁcation in the ﬂowsheet is obtained: there are no primary sedimentation tanks and no sludge digestion units (Figure 4.28). Figure 4.28. Flowsheet of the extended aeration system (liquid phase) The consequence of this simpliﬁcation in the system is the energy expenditure for aeration, which is due, not only to the removal of the incoming BOD, but also for the aerobic digestion of the sludge in the reactor. On the other hand, the reduction in the availability of food and its practically complete assimilation by the biomass makes extended aeration one of the most efﬁcient sewage treatment processes in terms of BOD removal. c) Intermittent operation (sequencing batch reactors) The activated sludge systems described above are of continuous ﬂow with relation to the sewage, that is, the sewage is always entering and leaving the reactor. How- ever, there is a variant of the system which has intermittent ﬂow and operation, also called a sequencing batch reactor (SBR).

The principle of the activated sludge process with intermittent operation con- sists in the incorporation of all the units, processes and operations normally associated to the conventional activated sludge (primary sedimentation, biological oxidation, secondary sedimentation, sludge pumping) within a single tank. Using only a single tank, these processes and operations become sequences in time and not separated units, such as in conventional processes with continuous ﬂow. The process of activated sludge with intermittent ﬂow can be used in the conventional or in the extended aeration sludge ages, although the latter is more common, due to its greater operational simplicity. In the extended aeration mode, the tank also incorporates the role of the sludge digestion (aerobic) unit. The process consists of a complete-mix reactor where all the treatment stages occur. This is accomplished by the establishment of operating cycles with deﬁned duration. The biological mass stays in the reactor, eliminating the need for separate sedimentation and sludge pumping. The retention of biomass occurs because it is not withdrawn with the supernatant (ﬁnal efﬂuent) after the sedimentation stage, remaining in the tank. The normal treatment cycle is composed of the following stages: • Fill (entrance of the inﬂuent in the reactor) • React (aeration/mixture of the liquid/biomass contained in the reactor) • Settle (sedimentation and separation of the suspended solids from the treated sewage) • Draw (removal of the supernatant, which is the treated efﬂuent from the reactor) • Idle (cycle adjustment and removal of the excess sludge) The usual duration of each stage within the cycle can be altered as a function of the inﬂuent ﬂow variations, the treatment needs and the sewage and biomass characteristics. The wasting of excess sludge generally occurs during the last stage (idle), whose purpose is to allow the adjustment of the stages within the operating cycles of each reactor. However, as this stage is optional or may be short, sludge wasting can happen in other phases of the process. The sludge wasting quantity and frequency are established in function with the performance requirements, in the same way as in the conventional continuous ﬂow processes. The ﬂowsheet of the process is greatly simpliﬁed due to the elimination of various units, compared with the continuous ﬂow activated sludge systems. The only units in an SBR operating in the extended aeration mode are: screens, grit chamber, reactors, sludge thickener (optional) and sludge drying (Figure 4.29).

Flowsheet of a sequencing batch reactor system in the extended aeration mode (liquid phase) d) Activated sludge with biological nitrogen removal The activated sludge system is capable of producing, without process alterations, a satisfactory conversion of ammonia to nitrate (nitriﬁcation). In this case, only ammonia and not nitrogen is removed, as there is only a conversion of the nitrogen form. Nitriﬁcation occurs almost systematically in warm-climate regions unless there is some environmental problem in the aeration tank, such as lack of dissolved oxygen, low pH, little biomass or the presence of toxic or inhibiting substances. Biological nitrogen removal is achieved in the absence of dissolved oxygen, but presence of nitrates (called anoxic conditions). In these conditions, a group of bacteria uses the nitrates in their respiration process, converting them to nitrogen gas, which escapes into the atmosphere. This process is called denitriﬁcation. To achieve denitriﬁcation in the activated sludge, process modiﬁcations are necessary, including the creation of anoxic zones and possible internal recycles. In spite of nitrogen removal being considered as tertiary treatment, biological removal is presented in this item of secondary treatment, as it consists of essentially biological processes and can be achieved through adaptations in the ﬂowsheet of the activated sludge process at a secondary level. In activated sludge systems where nitriﬁcation occurs (mainly in warm-climate regions), it is interesting to induce denitriﬁcation to take place intentionally in the reactor. The reasons are usually associated to purely operational aspects, as well as to the ﬁnal efﬂuent quality: • Savings in oxygen (energy economy in the aeration). Under anoxic condi- tions, facultative bacteria remove BOD by using the nitrate in their respi- ratory processes, therefore leading to an economy of oxygen, or in other words, in the energy used for aeration. This economy partially compensates the energy expenditure for nitriﬁcation, which occurs, necessarily, under aerobic conditions.",

This economy partially compensates the energy expenditure for nitriﬁcation, which occurs, necessarily, under aerobic conditions. • Savings in alkalinity (preservation of the buffering capacity). During ni- triﬁcation, H+ ions are generated and alkalinity is consumed, which can lead to a decrease in the pH in the aeration tank. Conversely, denitriﬁca- tion consumes H+ and generates alkalinity, partially compensating the pH reduction mechanisms that occur in nitriﬁcation. • Operation of the secondary sedimentation tank (to avoid rising sludge). If denitriﬁcation occurs in the anoxic conditions in the secondary sedimenta- tion tanks, there will be a production of small nitrogen gas bubbles. These bubbles tend to adhere to the settling ﬂocs, dragging them to the surface and causing a loss of biomass and deterioration in the ﬁnal efﬂuent quality. • Nutrient control (eutrophication). The reduction of the nitrogen levels is important when the efﬂuent is discharged into sensitive water bodies that are subjected to eutrophication (see Chapter 3). The main process variants for nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation combined in a single reactor are listed below. • Pre-denitriﬁcation (nitrogen removal with carbon from the raw sewage) • Post-denitriﬁcation (nitrogen removal with carbon from endogenous respi- ration) • Bardenpho four-stage process • Oxidation ditches • Sequencing batch reactors e) Activated sludge with biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal Although phosphorus removal can be considered as a tertiary treatment, biological removal is presented in this section on secondary treatment because it consists of essentially biological mechanisms and can be achieved through adaptations of the activated sludge process ﬂowsheet at a secondary level. It is essential to have anaerobic and aerobic zones in the treatment line for the biological removal of phosphorus. The anaerobic zone is considered a biological selector for the phosphorus accumulating organisms. This zone allows an advan- tage in terms of competition for the phosphorus accumulating organisms, since they can assimilate the substrate of this zone before the other microorganisms. In this way, the anaerobic zone gives good conditions for the development or selection of a large population of phosphorus accumulating organisms in the system, which absorb substantial quantities of phosphorus from the liquid, much higher than the normal metabolic requirements. When the biological excess sludge is wasted from the system, phosphorus is removed, since it is present at high concentrations in the phosphorus accumulating organisms that are part of the withdrawn sludge. Some of the main processes used for both nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the activated sludge system are listed below. Processes",

For this reason, nitrogen removal is encouraged, even if, in terms of the water body requirements, there is only the need to remove phosphorus. The literature presents a diverging nomenclature in relation to some processes, as a function of variations between commercial and scientiﬁc designations. • A2O process (three-stage Phoredox) • Five-stage Bardenpho process (Phoredox) • UCT process • Modiﬁed UCT process • Sequencing batch reactors If higher efﬁciencies are still desired for phosphorus removal, efﬂuent polishing can adopted. Methods employed are: • addition of coagulants (metallic ions): phosphorus precipitation • efﬂuent ﬁltration: removal of the phosphorus present in the suspended solids in the efﬂuent • combination of the addition of coagulants and ﬁltration These physical–chemical polishing methods can also be employed for P removal from other biological wastewater treatment process, and not only from the activated sludge process. 4.5.6 Aerobic bioﬁlm reactors In this section, the aerobic units are bioﬁlm reactors, in which the biomass grows attached to a support medium. There are many variants within this broad concept, and the following ones are presented in this section: • Low rate trickling ﬁlter • High rate trickling ﬁlters • Submerged aerated bioﬁlters • Rotating biological contactors All systems may be used as post-treatment of the efﬂuent from anaerobic reactors. In this case, primary sedimentation tanks are substituted by the anaerobic reactor, and the excess sludge from the aerobic stage, if not yet stabilised, is pumped back to the anaerobic reactor, where it undergoes thickening and digestion. a) Low rate trickling ﬁlter A trickling ﬁlter consists of a coarse material bed, such as stones, gravel, blast furnace slag, plastic material or other, over which the wastewater is applied, in the form of drops or jets. After application, the wastewater percolates in the direction of the drains at the bottom. This percolation allows the bacterial growth on the",

After application, the wastewater percolates in the direction of the drains at the bottom. This percolation allows the bacterial growth on the surface of the support medium, forming an attached bioﬁlm. With the passage of the wastewater, there is a contact between the microorganisms and the organic matter. The trickling ﬁlters are aerobic systems because the air circulates between the empty spaces between the stones, supplying the oxygen for the respiration of the microorganisms. The ventilation is usually natural. Wastewater is usually applied over the medium through rotating distributors, moved by the hydraulic head of the wastewater. The liquid percolates rapidly through the support medium. However, the microbial ﬁlm adsorbs the organic mat- ter, which stays adhered for a time sufﬁcient for its stabilisation (see Figure 4.30). Figure 4.30. Schematics of a trickling ﬁlter The ﬁlters are normally circular and can be of various sizes in diameter (several metres). Contrary to what the name suggests, the primary function of the ﬁlter is not toﬁlter.The diameter soft hestonesusedare of the order of a few centimetres,which allows a large void space that is inefﬁcient for the act of ﬁltration by screening. The function of the medium is only to supply support for the formation of the microbial ﬁlm. There are also synthetic media of various materials and forms, which present the advantage of being lighter than stone, besides having a higher surface area. However, the synthetic media are more expensive. The savings in construction costs must be analysed together with the greater expenditure in purchasing the synthetic media. With the biomass growth on the surface of the stones, the empty spaces tend to decrease, increasing the liquid velocity through the pores. When growth reaches a certain level, the velocity causes a shearing stress that dislodges part of the attached material. This is a natural form of controlling the microbial population in the medium. The dislodged sludge must be removed by the secondary sedimentation tanks to reduce the level of suspended solids in the ﬁnal efﬂuent.",

The dislodged sludge must be removed by the secondary sedimentation tanks to reduce the level of suspended solids in the ﬁnal efﬂuent. The applied BOD load per unit area and volume is lower in the low rate trickling ﬁlters. Therefore, food availability is low, which results in a partial self digestion of the sludge (self consumption of the cellular organic matter) and a higher BOD removal efﬁciency in the system. This is analogous to what happens in the extended aeration activated sludge system. This lower BOD load per surface unit of the tank is associated with higher area requirements when compared with high rate systems, which are described in the following item. The low rate trickling ﬁlters are still more efﬁcient in the removal of ammonia by nitriﬁcation. The low rate system is conceptually simple. Although the efﬁciency of the system is comparable with the conventional activated sludge system, the operation is simpler, although less ﬂexible. The trickling ﬁlters have a lower capacity to adjust to inﬂuent variations, besides requiring a slightly higher total area. In terms of energy consumption, the ﬁlters present a very low consumption in relation to the activated sludge system. Figure 4.31 presents a typical ﬂowsheet of low rate trickling ﬁlters. Figure 4.31. Typical ﬂowsheet of a low rate trickling ﬁlter (liquid phase) b) High rate trickling ﬁlters High rate trickling ﬁlters are conceptually similar to the low rate ﬁlters. However, because the high rate units receive a higher BOD load per unit volume of the bed, there are the following main differences: (a) the area requirements are lower; (b) there is a slight reduction in the organic matter removal efﬁciency; (c) sludge is not digested in the ﬁlter. Another difference is with respect to the existence of a recirculation of the ﬁnal efﬂuent. This is done with the main objectives of: (a) maintaining an approximately uniform ﬂow during all the day (at night, the distributors could not rotate, due to the low ﬂow, eventually drying the sludge); (b) balancing the inﬂuent load; (c) giving a new contact chance of the efﬂuent organic matter with the biomass; and (d) bringing dissolved oxygen into the incoming liquid. The difference from the activated sludge system is that the recirculation of the high rate ﬁlters is of the liquid efﬂuent and not of the sludge from the secondary sedimentation tanks (Figure 4.32).",

The difference from the activated sludge system is that the recirculation of the high rate ﬁlters is of the liquid efﬂuent and not of the sludge from the secondary sedimentation tanks (Figure 4.32). Another way of improving the efﬁciency of trickling ﬁlters or to treat waste- waters with high concentrations of organic waste is by using two ﬁlters in se- ries. This is called a two-stage trickling ﬁlter system. There are various possible conﬁgurations with different forms of efﬂuent recirculation. Some of the limitations of stone-bed trickling ﬁlters when operating with high organic loads refer to clogging of the void spaces, due to the excessive growth of the bioﬁlm. In these conditions, ﬂooding (ponding) and system failures may occur. If land availability is of concern, a careful consideration of the ﬁlter media must be exercised. The most commonly used material is still stones and gravel. However, the empty volume is limited in a trickling ﬁlter with stones, thus restricting the air circulation in the ﬁlter and consequently the quantity of oxygen available for the microorganisms and the quantity of wastewater that can be treated. The speciﬁc surface area (exposure area per unit volume of the medium) is also low, reducing the available sites for bioﬁlm attachment and growth. To overcome these limitations, other materials can be used. These materials include corrugated plastic modules, plastic rings and others. These materials offer larger surface areas for the bacterial growth (approximately double that of typical stones), besides the signiﬁcant increase in the empty spaces for air circulation. These materials are much lighter than stones (around 30 times), which allows the ﬁlters to be much higher without causing structural problems. While ﬁlters with stones are usually less than 3 metres in height, ﬁlters with synthetic media can be more than 6 metres high, substantially reducing the land required for the installation of the ﬁlters. c) Submerged aerated bioﬁlters A submerged aerated bioﬁlter consists of a tank ﬁlled with a porous material, through which wastewater and air permanently ﬂow. In almost all of the existing processes, the porous medium is maintained under total immersion. The bioﬁlter is a three-phase reactor composed of (Gon¸calves, 1996): • Solid phase: consists of a support medium and microorganism colonies that develop in the form of a bioﬁlm",

Bioﬁlters with granular media remove, in the same reactor, soluble organic compounds and suspended solids from the wastewater. Besides serving as support medium for the microorganisms, the granular material performs as an effective ﬁlter. In this type of bioﬁlter, periodic washing is necessary to eliminate the accu- mulated biomass, reducing the hydraulic head losses through the medium. During washing, the feeding with the wastewater is interrupted, and various sequential hydraulic discharges are made with air and cleaning water (Gon¸calves, 1996). The ﬂowsheet of a system composed of a submerged aerated ﬁlter is presented in Figure 4.33. The two sources of sludge generation are the primary sedimentation tanks and the washing of the bioﬁlter. The sludge from the washing is collected in a storage tank and pumped to the primary sedimentation tank for clariﬁcation outside peak ﬂow times. Therefore, the sludge sent to the sludge treatment stage is a mixed sludge, comprising primary sludge and biological sludge (Gon¸calves, 1996).Submerged aerated bioﬁlters are also being successfully applied for the post- treatment of UASB reactors. The aerobic sludge is returned to the UASB reactor, where it undergoes thickening and digestion, thereby simplifying substantially the overall ﬂowsheet (see Figure 4.24) (Chernicharo et al, 2001).

The discs rotate slowly and maintain at each instant around half the surface immersed in the sewage and the other half exposed to the air. Biomass grows attached to the discs, forming a bioﬁlm (see Figure 4.34). BIODISC SURFACE EXPOSED TO AIR IMMERSED SURFACE Figure 4.34. Schematics of a tank with biodiscs The discs usually are less than 3.6 metres in diameter and are generally con- structed of low weight plastic. When the system is put into operation, the microor- ganisms of the sewage start to adhere to the rotating surfaces, where they grow until the entire disk surface is covered with a ﬁne biological layer, a few millimetres thick. As the discs rotate, the part of the disc exposed to the air brings a thin layer of wastewater, allowing oxygen absorption through the drops and percolation on the surface of the discs. After the discs complete a rotation, this ﬁlm mixes itself with the wastewater, bringing still some oxygen and mixing the partially and fully treated sewage. With the passage of the microorganisms attached to the disc sur- face through the wastewater, they absorb a new quantity of organic matter that is used as food. When the biological layer reaches an excessive thickness, it detaches from the discs. Part of these detached microorganisms is maintained in suspension in the liquid due to the movement of the disk, which increases the efﬁciency of the system. The main purposes of the discs are: • to serve as the surface for microbial ﬁlm growth; • to promote the contact between the microbial ﬁlm and the sewage; • to maintain the biomass that detached from the discs in suspension in the liquid; • to promote the aeration of the sewage that is adhered to the disc and the sewage immersed in the liquid. The growth of the bioﬁlm is similar in concept to the trickling ﬁlter, with the difference that the microorganisms pass through the sewage, instead of the sewage passing through the microorganisms, like in the ﬁlters. Like the trickling ﬁlter process, secondary sedimentation tanks are also necessary, with the objetive of removing the suspended solids.",

The processes listed above are capable of reaching a coliform removal of 99.99% or more. Regarding pathogenic organisms, bacteria removal efﬁciency is very high (equal to or higher than coliform removal), and the other pathogens (protozoa, virus, helminths) are usually high, but variable, depending on the removal mech- anism and the resistance of each species.",

If the decision regarding economic aspects may seem relatively simple, the same may not be the case with the financial aspects. Besides, the technical points are in many cases intangible and in a large number of situations, the final decision can still have Table 4.6. Main processes for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms in sewage treatment Natural Maturation ponds: • Shallow ponds, where the penetration of solar ultraviolet radiation and unfavourable environmental conditions causes a high mortality of the pathogens. • The maturation ponds do not need chemical products or energy, but require large areas. • They are highly recommended systems (if there is area available), owing to their great simplicity and low costs. Land treatment (inﬁltration in soil): • The unfavourable environmental conditions in the soil favour the mortality of the pathogens. • In slow-rate systems, there is the possibility of plant contamination, depending on the type of application. • Chemical products are not needed. • Requires large areas. Chlorination: • Chlorine kills pathogenic microorganisms (although protozoan cysts and helminth eggs are not much affected). • High dosages are necessary, which may increase operational costs. The larger the previous organic matter removal, the lower the chlorine dosage required. • There is a concern regarding the generation of toxic by-products to human beings. However, the great beneﬁt to public health in the removal of pathogens must be taken into consideration. • The toxicity caused by the residual chlorine in the water bodies is also of concern. The residual chlorine must have very low levels, frequently requiring dechlorination. • There is much experience with chlorination in the area of water treatment in various developing countries. Ozonisation: • Ozone is a very effective agent for the removal of pathogens. • Ozonisation is usually expensive, although the costs are reducing, making this alternative a competitive option in certain speciﬁc circumstances. • There is less experience with ozonisation in most developing countries. Ultraviolet radiation: • Ultraviolet radiation, generated by special lamps, affects the reproduction of the pathogenic agents. • Toxic by-products are not generated. • Ideally, the efﬂuent must be well clariﬁed for the radiation to penetrate well in the liquid mass. • This process has recently shown substantial development, which has made it more competitive or more advantageous than chlorination in various applications.",

Criteria or weightings can be attributed to the various aspects con- nected essentially with the reality in focus, so that the selection really leads to the most adequate alternative for the system under analysis. There are no such gener- alised formulas for this, and common sense and experience when attributing the relative importance of each technical aspect are essential.

In these regions, the critical items are usually: efﬁciency, relia- bility, sludge disposal aspects and land requirements. In developing regions, these ﬁrst items are organised in a similar manner of decreasing importance, but have a lower magnitude, in comparison with the developed regions. The main difference resides in what are considered the critical items for the developing regions: con- struction costs, sustainability, simplicity and operational costs. These items are of course important in developed regions, but cannot be usually considered critical. Table 4.7 presents general factors to be taken into account when selecting and evaluating unit operations and processes in wastewater treatment, while Table 4.8 presents environmental aspects to be considered in the selection of processes for wastewater treatment and sludge management. Each of these factors must be evaluated in terms of the local conditions and the technology employed. The reliability of the monitoring system must also be considered. 4.7.2 Comparison between the wastewater treatment systems Presented below is a comparative analysis between the main wastewater treatment systems (liquid and solid phases) applied to domestic sewage.

Table 4.7. Important factors to be considered when evaluating and selecting unit operations and processes. Process applicability: The applicability of a process is evaluated based on past experience, published data, data from operating works and from pilot plants. If new or unusual conditions are found, pilot scale studies are necessary. Applicable ﬂow: The process must be adequate for the expected ﬂow range. Acceptable ﬂow variation: The majority of the operations and processes must be designed to operate over a wide ﬂow range. The highest efﬁciency is usually obtained with a constant ﬂow, although some variation can be tolerated. Equalisation of the ﬂow could be necessary if the variation is very large. Inﬂuent characteristics: The characteristics of the inﬂuent wastewater affect the process types to be used (e.g. chemical or biological) and the requirements for their adequate operation. Inhibiting or refractory compounds: What are the constituents in the wastewater that could be inhibitory or toxic, and under what conditions? What constituents are not affected during the treatment? Climatic aspects: Temperature affects reaction rates of most chemical and biological processes. Temperature can also affect the physical operation of the units. High temperatures can accelerate odour generation. Process kinetics and reactor hydraulics: The design of the reactor is based on reaction kinetics. Kinetic data are normally obtained from experience, literature or pilot studies. Reactor conﬁguration also plays an important role in the removal of some constituents. Performance: Performance is normally measured in terms of the quality of the efﬂuent, which should be consistent with the discharge requirements and/or the discharge standards. Treatment residuals: The type, quality and quantity of the solids, liquids and gaseous by-products need to be known or estimated. If necessary, undertake a pilot study. Sludge processing: Are there limitations that could make the sludge processing and disposal expensive or unfeasible? What is the inﬂuence in the liquid phase of the loads recycled from the sludge treatment units? The selection of the sludge-processing system must be done in parallel with the selection of the treatment processes of the liquid phase. Environmental constraints: Environmental factors, such as prevailing winds and proximity to residential areas could restrict the use of certain processes, especially when odours are released. Noise and trafﬁc could affect the selection of the works location. Chemical product requirements: What resources and quantities must be guaranteed for the satisfactory operation of the unit",

Even though the sludge, in most of its handling stages, is constituted by more than 95% water, it is only by convention that it is called a solid phase, with the aim at distinguishing it from the wastewater, or the liquid ﬂow being treated (liquid phase). Owing to the greater volume and mass generated, compared with the other solid by-products, the present book covers the problems of sludge in greater depth. The following aspects need to be taken into consideration and quantiﬁed when planning the sludge management: • production of the sludge in the liquid phase",

The following aspects need to be taken into consideration and quantiﬁed when planning the sludge management: • production of the sludge in the liquid phase • wastage of the sludge from the liquid phase (removal to the sludge pro- cessing line) • wastage of the sludge from the solid phase (removal from the wastewater treatment plant to the sludge disposal or reuse site) The sludge production is a function of the wastewater treatment system used for the liquid phase. In principle, all the biological treatment processes gener- ate sludge. The processes that receive raw wastewater in primary settling tanks generate the primary sludge, which is composed of the settleable solids of the raw wastewater. In the biological treatment stage, there is the so-called biological sludge or secondary sludge. This sludge is the biomass that grows at the expense of the food supplied by the incoming sewage. If the biomass is not removed, it tends to accumulate in the system and eventually leaves with the ﬁnal efﬂuent, deterio- rating its quality in terms of suspended solids and organic matter. Depending on the treatment system, the primary sludge can be sent for treatment together with the secondary sludge. In this case, the resultant sludge of the mixture is called mixed sludge. In treatment systems that incorporate a physical–chemical stage for improving the performance of primary or secondary settling tanks, a chemical sludge is produced. Since sludge is produced, its wastage from the liquid phase is necessary. How- ever, not all the wastewater treatment systems need the continuous removal of this biomass. Some treatment systems can store the sludge for all the operating horizon of the works (e.g. facultative ponds), others require only an occasional withdrawal (e.g. anaerobic reactors) and others need the continuous or very fre- quent removal (e.g. activated sludge). The biological sludge withdrawn is also called excess sludge, surplus sludge, waste sludge or secondary sludge. Finally, the sludge is treated and processed in the solid phase stage, from where it is removed or wasted, going to ﬁnal disposal or reuse routes. Table 5.1 presents a summary description of the main types of solid by-products and their origin in wastewater treatment. All of the treatment processes start with preliminary treatment, where there is, necessarily, the generation of screened ma- terial and grit. The scum is variable from process to process and can or cannot occur systematically. The primary sludge is only generated in plants that have a primary treatment stage (primary sedimentation tank).

The biological treatment processes are described in Chapter 4. The chemical sludge is only produced in plants that explicitly incorporate a physical–chemical stage in the treatment of the liquid phase. Wastewater treatment processes based on land application also generate biomass, which is, in this case, mainly composed by the plant biomass related to the irrigated culture. This plant biomass can be used or disposed of after cutting or harvesting and possible processing. The analysis of the management of this biomass is outside the scope of the present text.",

Coarse solids • Screen :The solids removed in the screens include all of the organic and inorganic solids with dimensions greater than the free space between the bars. The organic material varies in function of the characteristics of the sewerage system and the season of the year. The removal can be manual or mechanical.2. Grit • Grit chamber :The grit usually consists of heavier inorganic solids that settle with relatively high velocities. The grit is removed in units called grit chambers that are settling tanks with a low hydraulic detention time, which is only sufﬁcient for the grit to settle. However, depending on the operating conditions, organic matter, mainly fats and grease, can also be removed.3. Scum • Grit chamber • Primary settling tank • Secondary settling tank • Stabilisation pond • Anaerobic tank :The scum removed from primary settling tanks consists of ﬂoating material that has been scraped from the surface; this includes grease, vegetable and mineral oils, animal fats, soaps, food wastes, vegetable and fruits peelings, hair, paper, cotton, cigarette tips and similar materials. The speciﬁc gravity of scum is less than 1.0 (generally around 0.95). The grit chambers do not usually have scum removal equipment. In secondary treatment, biological reactors also produce scum, which includes scum-forming microorganisms that develop under speciﬁc environmental conditions. This scum is usually removed in the secondary settling tanks by scraping the surface. Stabilisation ponds and anaerobic reactors can also present scum.4. Primary sludge • Septic tank • Primary settling tank :The solids removed by settling from primary sedimentation tanks constitute the primary sludge. Primary sludge can have a strong odour, principally if retained in the primary settling tank for a long time in high temperature conditions. The primary sludge removed from septic tanks stays a time long enough for its anaerobic digestion, under controlled conditions (closed tanks).",

Aerobic biological sludge (non- stabilised) • Conventional activated sludge • Aerobic bioﬁlm reactors – high rate (high rate trickling ﬁlter, submerged aerated bioﬁlter, rotating biological contactor) :The excess biological sludge (secondary sludge) consists of a biomass of aerobic microorganisms generated at the expense of the removal of the organic matter (substrate) from the wastewater. This biomass is in constant growth, resulting from the continuous input of organic matter into the biological reactors. To maintain the system in equilibrium, approximately the same mass of biological solids generated must be removed from the system. If the residence time of the solids in the system is low and there is a satisfactory level of substrate available, the biological solids will contain greater levels of organic matter in their cellular composition. These solids are not stabilised (digested), requiring a subsequent separate digestion stage. If no digestion is included, release of bad odours by the sludge during its treatment and ﬁnal disposal is likely to occur, because of the anaerobic decomposition of the organic matter under uncontrolled conditions.6. Aerobic biological sludge (stabilised): • Activated sludge – extended aeration • Aerobic bioﬁlm reactors – low rate (low rate trickling ﬁlter, rotating biological contactor, submerged aerated bioﬁlter) This biological sludge is also predominantly composed by aerobic microorganisms that grow and multiply themselves at the expense of the organic matter in the raw wastewater. However, in low loading rate systems, the availability of substrate is lower and the biomass is retained longer in the system, thus prevailing endogenous respiration conditions. Under these conditions, the biomass uses its own reserves of organic matter in the composition of the cellular protoplasm, which leads to a sludge with a lower level of organic matter (digested sludge) and higher level of inorganic solids. This sludge does not require a subsequent separate digestion stage.7. Anaerobic biological sludge (stabilised) • Stabilisation ponds (facultative ponds, anaerobic- facultative ponds, facultative aerated lagoons, complete-mix aerated lagoons – sedimentation lagoons)  • Anaerobic reactors (UASB reactors, anaerobic ﬁlters) :Anaerobic reactors and the sludge at the bottom of stabilisation ponds are in predominantly anaerobic conditions. The anaerobic biomass also grows and multiplies itself at the expense of the organic matter.

In stabilisation ponds, the sludge is also composed by settled solids from the raw sewage, together with dead algae. This sludge does not require a subsequent digestion stage.8. Chemical sludge • Primary settling tanks with chemical precipitation • Activated sludge with chemical phosphorus precipitation :This sludge is usually a result of chemical precipitation with metallic salts or lime. The concern with odours is less than with the primary sludge, although it still can occur (only in the case of the use of lime as a coagulant). The decomposition rate of the chemical sludge in the tanks is less than the primary sludge. Source: adapted from Metcalf & Eddy (1991) and von Sperling and Gon¸calves (2001) Theterm‘sludge’hasbeenusedtodesignatethesolidby-productsfromwastew- ater treatment. In the biological treatment processes, part of the organic matter is absorbed and converted into microbial biomass, generically called biological or secondary sludge. This is principally composed of biological solids, and for this reason it is also called a biosolid. To adopt this term, it is still necessary that its chemical and biological characteristics are compatible with a productive use, such as for example in agriculture. The term ‘biosolid’ is a way of emphasising its beneﬁcial aspects, giving more value to productive uses, in comparison with the mere ﬁnal non-productive disposal by means of landﬁlls or incineration. 5.2 RELATIONSHIPS IN SLUDGE: SOLIDS LEVELS, CONCENTRATION AND FLOW To express the characteristics of the sludge, as well as to calculate the sludge production in terms of mass and volume, the understanding of certain fundamental relations that are covered below are essential. a) Relation between solids levels and water content The relation between the level of dry solids and the water content in the sludge is given by: Water content (%) = 100 – Dry solids level (%) (5.1) A sludge with a level of dry solids of 2% has a water content of 98%. Therefore, in every 100 kg of sludge, 98 kg are water and 2 kg are solids.",

Therefore, in every 100 kg of sludge, 98 kg are water and 2 kg are solids. The water content inﬂuences the mechanical properties of the sludge and these inﬂuence the handling processes and the ﬁnal disposal of the sludge. The relation between the water content and the mechanical properties in most forms of sludges is (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994): The table shows that for a Water content ranging from 100% to 75%, the Dry-solids content is 0% to 25%, and the Mechanical properties of the sludge are described as fluid sludge; when the Water content is between 75% and 65%, the Dry-solids content is 25% to 35%, resulting in semi-solid cake; for a Water content of 65% to 40%, the Dry-solids content is 35% to 60%, corresponding to a hard solid; with a Water content from 40% to 15%, the Dry-solids content is 60% to 85%, producing sludge in granules; and lastly, for a Water content of 15% to 0%, the Dry-solids content is 85% to 100%, where the sludge is disintegrating into a fine powder. In the present context, dry solids (d.s.) are equivalent to total solids ( TS), which, in the case of sludges, are very similar to total suspended solids (TSS or simply SS). These variables may be used interchangeably in this book, when representing solids concentration in the sludge. The water content has a large inﬂuence on the volume to be handled, as detailed in item d below. The water in the sludge can be divided into four distinct classes, with different degrees in the easiness of separation (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1994): • Free water. Can be removed by gravity (thickening, ﬂotation) • Adsorbed water. Can be removed by mechanical forces or by the use of a ﬂocculating agent • Capillary water. Maintains itself adsorbed in the solid phase by capillary forces, and is distinguished from the adsorbed water by the need of a greater separation force • Cellular water. Is part of the solid phase and can only be removed by the change of the water aggregation state, that is, through freezing or evaporation b) Sludge density The density of the sludge during most of its processing is very close to water.",

The concentration can be in mg/L or in % (the latter being more frequent for sludge processing) and both are related by: Concentration (% ) = Concentration (mg/L) × 100 / 1 × 106(mg/kg) × Density (kg/L) (5.2) Since in most of the sludge processing stages the speciﬁc gravity is very close to 1.0 (except for the dewatered sludge), Equation 5.2 can be simpliﬁed to the following: Concentration (% ) ≈Concentration (mg/L) / 10,000 (5.3) For instance, a sludge with a concentration of 20,000 mg/L could have this same concentration expressed as 20,000/10,000 = 2.0% of dry solids. Thus, each 100 kg (or 100 litres) of sludge has 2 kg of dry solids (and 98 kg of water). To clarify the example even further, it can be said 1000 kg (or 1000 litres, or l m3) of sludge have 20 kg of dry solids (or 20,000 g of dry solids). Hence, there are 20,000 g of dry solids in l m3 of sludge or 20,000 gTS/m3 or 20,000 mgTS/L (mg/L = g/m3). d) Relation between ﬂow, concentration and load The design of the sludge treatment and ﬁnal disposal stages is based on the sludge ﬂow (volume per unit time) or in many cases, the dry solids load (mass per unit time). The sludge ﬂow is related to the SS load and concentration by: Flow = Load / Concentration (5.4) Sludge ﬂow (m3/d) = SS load (kgSS/d) / Dry solids (% ) /100 × Sludge density (kg sludge/m3sludge) (5.5) Considering that the density of the sludge in practically all of its processing stages is very close to 1000 kg/m3, Equation 5.5 can be simpliﬁed to: Sludge ﬂow (m3/d) = SS load (kgSS/d) / Dry solids (%) × 10 (5.6) A sludge with a solids load of 120 kgSS/d and a solids concentration of 2.0 % (20,000 mg/L) will have a ﬂow of 120/(2.0 × 10) = 120/20 = 6.0 m3/d.",

To estimate the SS load from the sludge ﬂow and SS concentration, the rear- rangement of the previous equations can be used: Load = Flow × Concentration Load (kgSS/d) = Flow (m3/d) × Concentration (g/m3) / 1000 (g/kg) (5.7) The conversion of the units is based on the fact that mg/L is the same as g/m3 (as seen above). A sludge with 20,000 mg/L is the same as a with 20,000 g/m3. If the ﬂow is 6 m3/d, the solids load will be 6 × 20,000/1000 = 120 kg of dry solids per day (or 120 kgSS/d or 120 kgTS/d) For an approximate calculation, it can still be said that the sludge volume (ﬂow) varies inversely with the dry solids concentration (for a sludge with a speciﬁc gravity equal to 1.0): Flow sludge 1 / Flow sludge2 = Conc. SS 2 (%) / Conc. SS 1 (%) (5.8) Therefore, a sludge with a SS concentration of 2.0% and a ﬂow of 6 m3/d will have the following ﬂow, if the SS concentration is raised to 5.0%: (6 m3/d ×2.0)/5.0 = 2.4 m3/d. The other 3.6 m3/d (= 6.0 −2.4) are the removed liquid from this stage, which needs to be returned to the head of the works. 5.3 QUANTITY OF SLUDGE GENERATED IN THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PROCESSES Table 5.2 presents typical sludge removal intervals from the treatment units of the liquid phase, from where the sludge goes to the treatment stage. The intervals are expressed as: continuous, hours, days, weeks, months, years, and decades. For example, the classiﬁcation of ‘months’ indicates that the sludge must be removed in the order of a few months from the treatment unit in the liquid phase to go on to the processing stage in the solid phase. The storage period has a large inﬂuence on the sludge characteristics and, as a result, on its treatment. Sludges removed in intervals of weeks, months, years or decades are usually thicker and already digested. The quantity of sludge generated in sewage treatment, and that should be di- rected to the sludge treatment stage, can be expressed in terms of mass and vol- ume.

Thickening is a physical process of concentrating the sludge, with the aim of reducing its water content and, as a result, its volume, facilitating the subsequent sludge treatment stages. Stabilisation aims at attenuating the inconveniences associated with the gen- eration of bad odours during processing and disposing of the sludge. This is ac- complished through the removal of the biodegradable organic matter of the sludge, what also brings about a reduction in the solids mass in the sludge. Conditioning is a sludge preparation process, based on the addition of chemical products (coagulants, polyelectrolytes) to increase its dewatering capability and to improve the capture of solids in the sludge dewatering systems. Thenextstageisthedewateringofthesludge,whichcanbedonethroughnatural or mechanical methods. The objective of this phase is to remove water and reduce the volume even further, producing a sludge with a mechanical behaviour close to solids. The dewatering of the sludge has an important impact in its transport and ﬁnal disposal costs, besides inﬂuencing its subsequent handling, since the mechanical behaviour varies with the water content level. The disinfection of the sludge is necessary if its destination is for agricultural recycling, since the anaerobic or aerobic digestion processes usually employed do not reduce the pathogens content to acceptable levels. Disinfection is not necessary if the sludge is to be incinerated or disposed of in landﬁlls.

For the Gravity thickening method, when applied to Primary sludge, it is Frequently used, with excellent results; for Activated sludge, it is Less frequent, owing to the small increase in the solid levels; for Mixed sludge (primary sludge and activated sludge), it is Frequently used; and for Mixed sludge (primary sludge and sludge from the aerobic biofilm reactor), it is also Frequently used. The Dissolved air flotation thickening method is Less frequent use for Mixed sludge (primary sludge and activated sludge), since results are similar to gravity thickeners, but is Frequently used for Activated sludge, with much better results than gravity thickening. Both the Centrifuge and Belt press thickening methods, when used for Activated sludge, are noted as having Increasing use. 5.5 SLUDGE THICKENING The main processes used for sludge thickening are: • gravity thickeners • dissolved air ﬂotation • centrifuges • belt presses Other mechanical processes used for dewatering can also be adapted to sludge thickening. Table 5.4 presents the typical uses of these processes. Table 5.5 presents typical thickened sludge concentrations, according to the thickening processes employed. Gravity thickeners have a similar structure to settling tanks. The format is usually circular with central feeding, a bottom sludge exit and a supernatant side exit. The thickened sludge goes on to the next stage (normally digestion), while the supernatant is returned to the head of the works. Figure 5.2 presents a schematics of a gravity thickener. In the process of dissolved air ﬂotation, air is introduced in a solution main- tained at high pressure. In these conditions, the air is dissolved. When there is a depressurisation, the dissolved air is released in the form of small bubbles. These bubbles, with an upward movement, tend to carry the sludge particles to the sur- face, from where they are removed. Thickening by ﬂotation has a good applicability for activated sludge, which does not thicken well in gravity thickeners. Dissolved air ﬂotation also has good applicability in WWTPs with biological phosphorus",

    "text_to_embed": "5.6 SLUDGE STABILISATION Raw sewage sludge is rich in microorganisms, decomposes easily and quickly releases offensive odours. The stabilisation processes were developed with the  objective of stabilising (digesting) the biodegradable fraction of the organic matter present in the sludge, thus decreasing the risk of putrefaction, as well as reducing the concentration of pathogens. Table 5.6 shows the main differences between raw and anaerobically digested sludge. The stabilisation processes can be divided into (see Figure 5.3): • biological stabilisation: use of speciﬁc bacteria to promote the stabilisation of the biodegradable fraction of the organic matter • chemical stabilisation: the stabilisation is achieved by the chemical oxi- dation of the organic matter • thermal stabilisation: obtained from the action of heat on the volatile fraction in hermetically closed recipients. Anaerobic digestion is the most frequently used sludge stabilisation process. Aerobic digestion is less diffused, but has a good applicability in the stabilisation of the excess activated sludge originating from WWTPs with biological nutrient removal. Composting processes are common in urban solid waste treatment works, but only in a limited number of small-scale WWTPs. Alkaline treatment and thermal drying are other processes used in sludge stabilisation. The main methods of ﬁnal sludge disposal associated with different stabilisation processes can be found in Table 5.7. The stabilisation of the sludge facilitates its ﬁnal disposal and opens alternatives for its reuse as an agricultural soil conditioner. From the various sewage treatment systems listed in Table 5.2, it is seen that the degree of stabilisation of the sludge produced varies according to the treatment process used.",

Sludge stabilisation technologies and ﬁnal disposal methods Anaerobic/aerobic digestion: Produces a biosolid that is suitable to be used with restrictions in agriculture, such as a soil conditioner and organic fertiliser. Usually followed by dewatering. Needs disinfection post-treatment for unrestricted use in agriculture. Chemical treatment (lime stabilisation): Agricultural use or in the daily cover of a sanitary landﬁll. Composting: Agricultural humus-like product, appropriate for use in nurseries, horticulture and landscaping. Usually adopted after sludge dewatering. Thermal drying: Product with a high level of solids, signiﬁcant nitrogen concentration and free from pathogens. Indicated for unrestricted agricultural use. The process of anaerobic digestion has been known by sanitary engineers since the end of the 19th century and is characterised by the stabilisation of the organic matter in an environment free from molecular oxygen. Owing to its robustness and high efﬁciency, anaerobic digestion is present from simple domestic septic tanks acting as an individual residential solution, up to completely automated plants, serving large metropolitan regions. In a conventional activated sludge or trickling ﬁlter plant, the mixture between primary sludge and excess biological sludge is stabilised biologically under anaer- obic conditions and converted into methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2).alternatives for its reuse as an agricultural soil conditioner. From the various sewage treatment systems listed in Table 5.2, it is seen that the degree of stabilisation of the sludge produced varies according to the treatment process used. The process is done in closed biological reactors known as anaerobic digesters. The digester is fed in a continuous or batch form and the sludge is maintained inside it for a certain detention time. The anaerobic digesters are constructed of concrete or steel. The raw sludge is mixed – and heated in temperate climate countries – with the gas produced, and the gas is stored in ﬂoating gasholders for processing or burning. The conﬁguration of the digesters varies according to land availability, the need for maintaining a completely-mixed regime and the removal of grit and scum. Figure 5.4 illustrates cylindrical and oval anaerobic digesters. 5.7 SLUDGE DEWATERING Dewatering is done with digested sludges and has an important impact on the sludge transportation and ﬁnal disposal costs. The main reasons for sludge dewatering are: • reduction of the transportation costs to the ﬁnal disposal site; • improvement of the handling conditions of the sludge, since dewatered sludge is easier to be handled and transported; • increase of the caloriﬁc value of the sludge, through the reduction of the water aiming at preparing it for incineration; • reduction in the volume for",

Drying lagoons are generall excavated in the soil, located in natural depressions in the land, or put inside banks, where the discarded sludge from the WWTPs is accumulated for prolonged time periods (from 3 to 5 years). During this period, the sludge is thickened by the ac- tion of gravity, further digested by the microorganisms present in the sludge, and dewatered through drainage of the free water and evaporation. The process is only recommended for dewatering previously digested sludge by aerobic or anaerobic methods, and not for use in the dewatering of primary or mixed sludge. Among the natural dewatering processes, the sludge lagoons are much less used than drying beds. The main difference between this process and the drying beds resides in the fact that evaporation is the principal mechanism of inﬂuence in the dewatering process. Percolation has a lesser effect than in the drying beds. The dewatering in the lagoon can be accelerated with the use of devices for the removal of the supernatant water at various levels after the loading of the sludge (Figure 5.6). The use of drains at the bottom is not common practice in drying lagoons, because the sewage sludge has reduced drainability and the risk of pipe blocking is very likely to occur. When the lagoon is full, it can be put out of operation without the removal of the sludge, thus serving as a solution for ﬁnal disposal.

In a ﬁrst stage, the sludge particles settle at a velocity much higher than would occur under the action of gravity. In a second stage, compaction occurs when the sludge loses part of the capillary water under the prolonged action of centrifugation. The cake is removed from the process after this last dewatering stage. Centrifuges are equipment that may be used indistinctly for sludge thickening and dewatering. The operating principle is the same, and it is possible to install the centrifuges in series, the ﬁrst for the thickening of the sludge and the second for the dewatering. The main types of centrifuges used for sludge dewatering are vertical and horizontal-shaft centrifuges. The main differences are in the type of feeding of the sludge, the intensity of the centrifugal force and the manner in which the cake and the liquid are unloaded from the equipment. Currently, the majority of treatment plants that dewater sludge by centrifugation use horizontal- shaft centrifuges. The semi-continuous feeding of the sludge and relatively lower solids levels in the cake produced by the vertical-shaft centrifuges are some of the reasons for this preference. Horizontal centrifuges can be classiﬁed according to the direction of the sludge feeding and the removal of the cake as co-current and counter-current. Their main differences reside in the sludge feeding points, in the removal of the centrate (liquid phase removal) and in the direction of the ﬂow of the solid and liquid phases in its interior. In the co-current centrifuges, the solid and the liquid phases cross all the extension of the longitudinal shaft of the equipment, until they",

When compared with more modern sludge dewatering processes, their use entered into decline due to the high-energy consumption and lower efﬁciency. A vacuum ﬁlter consists of a rotating cylindrical drum installed with partial submergence in a tank with conditioned sludge. Around 10 to 40% of the drum surface is submerged in the tank; this part forms the ﬁltration or the cake formation zone. The cake is formed in the outer part of the cylinder, while the ﬁltered liquid migrates to the interior, where there is a vacuum.

A valve brings the surface of the cylinder to the atmospheric pressure in this region, and the sludge cake is separated from the ﬁltering medium. Figure 5.8 shows a typical set up of a vacuum ﬁlter system. e) Filter press A ﬁlter press operates in an intermittent mode, with cycles consisting of sludge loading, ﬁltration, and cake unloading stages. The liquid sludge is pumped into plates surrounded by ﬁlter cloths. The pumping of the sludge increases the pressure in the space between the plates and forces the sludge to pass through the ﬁlter cloth. The solids are then retained on the ﬁltering medium, forming the cake. Next, a hydraulic piston pushes a steel plate against the other polyethylene plates, making up the pressing. The ﬁltrate (liquid) goes through the ﬁlter cloths and is collected by the plate outlet ports. The cake is easily removed from the ﬁlter when the pneumatic piston is retreated and the plates are separated. At this moment, the dry cake falls from the plate and can be taken to storage or ﬁnal destination. Figure 5.9 presents a typical set up of a ﬁlter press.

The equipment operates in batch mode, what requires the intervention of trained operators, and has as a main characteristic a high reliability. The principal advantages of ﬁlter presses are: • high concentration of solids in the cake (higher than from other mechanised dewatering processes); • high solids capture; • clariﬁed liquid efﬂuent; • low consumption of chemical products for sludge conditioning; • reliability. Currently ﬁlter presses are automated, which reduces labour needs. The weight of the equipment, its purchasing costs, and the need for the regular substitution of the ﬁlter cloths usually make the utilisation of ﬁlter presses limited to medium and large size WWTPs. f) Belt press Belt presses operate on a continuous mode. The operation process of a belt press can be divided into three distinct stages and zones: (a) zone of gravity drainage, (b) low-pressure zone and (c) high-pressure zone. The zone of gravity drainage is located at the entrance of the press, where the sludge is applied onto an upper screen and the free water percolates under the action of gravity through the opening pores in the screen. After this, the sludge is directed to the low-pressure zone, where the rest of the free water is removed and the sludge is gently compressed between the upper and lower screens.

In the high- rate pressure zone, which is formed by various rollers with different diameters in series, the sludge is progressively compressed between two screens with the objective of releasing the interstitial water. Finally, scrapers remove the sludge and high-pressure water jets wash the screens. Figure 5.10 presents a typical set up of a belt press system. Low acquisition cost sand reduced energy consumption are the mainadvantages. However, since the equipment is open, the belt press may have the following dis- advantages: aerosol emissions, high level of noise and eventual unpleasant odours (depending on the sludge type). Another large disadvantage of the belt press is the high number of rollers (40–50), which require operational attention and regular substitution. 5.8 SLUDGE DISINFECTION The objective of introducing a sludge disinfection stage in the sewage treatment works is to guarantee a low level of pathogens in the sludge, such that, when it is disposed of on land, will not cause health risks to the population and to the workers that will handle it and also negative impacts to the environment. However, the need to include a complementary sludge disinfection system will depend on the ﬁnal disposal alternative to be adopted. The application of sludge in public parks and gardens or its recycling in agri- culture implies a higher sanitary level than other disposal alternatives, such as landﬁlls. These requirements can be met by a sludge disinfection process or by temporary restrictions to public use and access.",

The application of sludge in public parks and gardens or its recycling in agri- culture implies a higher sanitary level than other disposal alternatives, such as landﬁlls. These requirements can be met by a sludge disinfection process or by temporary restrictions to public use and access. Some stabilisation processes of the organic matter in the sludge also lead to a reduction of pathogenic microorganisms, producing a sanitarily safe sludge. Others reduce the pathogenic microorganisms to levels lower than the detection limits, after the stabilisation of the organic matter, in a complementary sludge treatment stage. The most important processes are described below. a) Composting Composting is an aerobic organic matter decomposition process that is achieved through controlled conditions of temperature, water content, oxygen and nutrients. The resultant product (compost) has a high agricultural value as a soil conditioner. The inactivation of the pathogenic microorganisms occurs mainly by the increase of temperature during the highest activity phase of the process. The temperature reaches values between 55 and 65 ◦C by means of biochemical reactions. Raw sludge and digested sludge can be composted. Materials such as wood chips, leaves, green waste, rice straw, sawdust, or other structuring agents need to be added to the sludge to improve the water retention, increase the porosity, and balance the ratio between carbon and nitrogen. Reactor or Pile Sludge Bulking Agents Air Forced Aeration or Mixing MIXING AND REACTION CURING AND STORAGE The composting process can be carried out according to the three following main methods (see Figure 5.12 and Table 5.13): • Windrows. Periodical turning, in order to allow aeration and mixture. De- tention time between 50 and 90 days. • Aerated static pile. Aeration by perforated pipes from air blowers or ex- hausting systems. Detention time between 30 and 60 days. • In-vessel biological reactors. Closed systems, with a greater control and lower detention time. Detention time of at least 14 days in the reactor and 14 to 21 days for cooling.",

Windrows offer low investment and low operation and maintenance costs, but they require large areas, may cause odour issues, struggle to reach the required temperature, face possible mixing problems, and have a long composting period. Aerated static piles provide better odour control, improved conditions for temperature maintenance, and shorter reaction time, but they require investment in an aeration system and involve moderate operational and maintenance costs. Biological reactors need less land, offer a high degree of process control, and allow easy management of temperature and odours, yet they come with higher investment, operation, and maintenance costs, and are only economically viable at large scales. b) Thermophilic aerobic digestion The process of thermophilic aerobic digestion (also called autothermal digestion) follows the same principles as the conventional aerobic digestion system. The difference is that it operates in a thermophilic phase due to some alterations in the concept and operation of the system. In this process, the sludge is generally pre-thickened and operates with two aerobic stages, without the need of introducing energy to raise the temperature. Since the reaction volume is small, the system is closed and the concentration of solids in the sludge is higher, the heat released from the aerobic reactions heats the sludge to temperatures higher than 50 ◦C in the ﬁrst stage and 60 ◦C in the second.

Due to the temperature increase the pathogenic microorganisms are reduced to values lower than the detection limits if the sludge is maintained at a temperature between 55–60 ◦C for 10 days (or 5 to 6 days for reactors in series). The mixing and aeration efﬁciency are the two most important factors for the operational success of the system. c) Lime stabilisation Lime stabilisation is used to treat primary, secondary, or digested sludge. When a sufﬁcient quantity of lime is added to the sludge to increase the pH to 12, a reduction of the population of microorganisms (including pathogens) and the po- tential occurrence of odours takes place. Lime can be added to liquid or dewatered sludges (see Figures 5.13 and 5.14). Owing to the addition of lime, the quantity of sludge to be disposed of increases. d) Pasteurisation Pasteurisation involves the heating of the sludge to 70 ◦C for 30 minutes, followed by a rapid cooling to 4 ◦C. The sludge can be heated by heat exchangers or by hot steam injection. The steam injection process is more commonly used and the sludge is pasteurised in batch to decrease the recontamination risks.",

To be economically feasible, the sludge needs to be previously digested and dewatered to a solids concentration in the order of 20–35%, before being thermally treated.

This stage is highly important, since the selected alternative will be a result of all the con- siderations and studies completed in this phase. Consequently, efforts should be directed to obtaining data and subsequently drawing the conclusions, always aim- ing at the highest possible accuracy and reliability, since the technical success and the economic feasibility of the chosen alternative depend largely on this initial analysis. Preliminary studies are an integral part of the planning stage of the design, which comprise the following fundamental elements: • Quantitative characterisation of the inﬂuent wastewater (domestic ﬂow, inﬁltration ﬂow, industrial ﬂow) • Qualitative characterisation of the inﬂuent wastewater (domestic sewage, industrial wastewater) • Population forecast studies ",

The selection criteria for the initial screening of alternatives are described in Chapters 4 and 5. Some of the other topics are commented individually in the present chapter. An in depth analysis of these items is not the objective of the chapter, but only to emphasise their importance within the conception and design of the sewage treatment works. Presented below are short comments on the integration of the points listed above within the preliminary studies phase. • Quantiﬁcation of the polluting loads. Initially a quantiﬁcation of the pol- luting loads needs to be made, based on the quantity and quality of the wastewater. The design population, ﬂows and polluting loads need to be estimated on a yearly (or almost) basis until the end of the design horizon, in order to allow the deﬁnition of the staging periods (design stages). (See Chapter 2 for polluting loads and forecasts and current chapter for staging periods studies.) • Treatment objectives. The treatment level and the required removal efﬁcien- cies and efﬂuent quality need to be well deﬁned, based on the interaction between the predicted impacts on the water body from the discharge of the efﬂuent and the intended uses for this water body. (See Chapter 3.) • Site selection. Possible sites for the implementation of the treatment plant need to be selected, based on a number of considerations, such as size, geology, topography, ground-water level, ﬂooding level, distance of the in- tercepting lines, accessibility, neighbouring houses, environmental impact, economics etc. Different sites may be selected, depending on the treatment system to be employed (processes with small or large land requirements).

The preliminary engineering design is undertaken for the selected alternatives in such a way as to produce data and information to support the subsequent economical analysis. Sub-alternatives may be analysed, such as tank formats, aeration system, sludge treatment options, etc., which may be deﬁned by separate in-parallel comparative technical- economic studies. (See relevant sections in this book, related to each treat- ment process.) • Layout and design of the main units. Plant layouts, showing in scale the physical arrangement of the units on site should be drawn for the selected alternatives. In order to support the subsequent costs estimates, drawings of the main units should be made, showing the main details that could inﬂuence the costs. The preliminary design and the corresponding lay- outs should be made based on site-speciﬁc data, such as topography and geology.

In many cases it is sufﬁcient to compare only those items which are not common to the options. The economic analysis should take into consideration the construction as well as the operating costs. All of the costs should be brought to the present value, allowing a comparison according to a common basis. (See current chapter.) • Environmental impact assessment. The impacts of the implementation and running of the plant must be taken into account, including the positive im- pacts resulting from the improvement in the quality of the receiving water body, but also occasional negative impacts associated with the construction, day-to-day operation and occasionally occurring operational problems. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) techniques, such as evaluation matrices, may be employed, and the pertinent legislation must be followed. • Selection of the proposed alternative.

These two concepts may be understood as (Qasim, 1985): • Design horizon or planning period: period between the initial year and the ﬁnal year of the plant operation • Staging periods: the time intervals when plant expansions are made The design horizon of a sewage treatment works should be relatively short, preferably 20 years or less. The design horizon should still be divided into staging periods, in the order of 7 to 10 years. The larger the population growth rate, the more important is the subdivision into stages, the greater should be the number of staging periods and the lower the duration of each stage. High population growth rates are observed in many urban areas of developing countries. On the other hand, very short stages should be avoided in view of the disturbances associated with the almost continuous coexistence with construction works in the plant. The preliminary studies should be done considering the whole design horizon, in order to allow the estimation of the full land requirements for the plant. However, the detailed design and the construction of the units should be conﬁned to each implementation stage. Some reasons for this are: • The division in stages is an economically positive factor, which postpones a considerable part of the investments to the future, thus reducing the present value of the construction costs. The higher the interest rates, the greater are the savings. • For each new stage the design parameters can be reviewed, especially the ﬂows and the incoming loads, as well as the data obtained with the opera- tional experience of the plant itself. • Over dimensioned units can generate problems, such as septicity in settling tanks (higher than desired detention time), excessive aeration, etc. • The staging allows the continuous follow-up of the development of the wastewater treatment technology, allowing more modern solutions to be adopted, which may be, in many cases, the most efﬁcient and economical ones. Therefore, the design of the plant should foresee ﬂexibility for the integration of the existing or ﬁrst-stage units with future units.",

In addition, the main dimen- sions of the units, the area occupied, the earth cut and ﬁll volumes, the concrete volumes,theenergytobeconsumed,therequiredequipmentandotheritemsjudged of relevance in the works in question should be known. Such knowledge serves as the basis for the preliminary cost estimates, which can support the economical study. For the preliminary design, focus is given to process calculations, without the need to deepen in detailing the units and in the hydraulic calculations of pipes and interconnections. The various design examples presented in this book are at the preliminary-design level. 6.4 c The costs for wastewater treatment vary widely with the characteristics of the wastewater, treatment process, climate, design criteria, local conditions and unit local costs for labour, materials, land, and energy. The cost estimate should comprise the implementation costs (concentrated in time) and the annual operation costs (distributed in time). These costs include (Arceivala, 1981): • Implementation costs • construction costs (including equipment and installation) • buying or expropriation of the land • project costs and supervision, legal taxes • interests on the loans during the construction period • Annual costs • interests on the loans • annual payment for capital recovery • depreciation of the works • insurance of the works • operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the works Of the annual costs, the ﬁrst four items can be considered as ﬁxed since they have to be included if the plant is working or not. In the preliminary economic studies, the costs for construction and land acquisition (implementation) and operation and maintenance (annual) are usually considered. The present section does not intend to cover the criteria for the making of cost surveys and economical studies. Some simple Economical Engineer- ing methods are presented, which allow the conversion of implementation and annual costs to a common basis that can be used for the comparison between alternatives.",
